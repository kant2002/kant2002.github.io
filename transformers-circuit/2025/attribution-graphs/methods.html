<p style="grid-column: page; margin: 4px; margin-top: 40px; margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; mix-blend-mode: multiply;">We introduce a method to uncover mechanisms underlying behaviors of language models. We produce graph descriptions of the model’s computation on prompts of interest by tracing individual computational steps in a “replacement model”. This replacement model substitutes a more interpretable component (here, a “cross-layer transcoder”) for parts of the underlying model (here, the multi-layer perceptrons) that it is trained to approximate. We develop a suite of visualization and validation tools we use to investigate these “attribution graphs” supporting simple behaviors of an 18-layer language model, and lay the groundwork for a <a href='./biology.html'>companion paper</a> applying these methods to a frontier model, Claude 3.5 Haiku.</p>

<p>Deep learning models produce their outputs using a series of transformations distributed across many computational units (artificial “neurons”). The field of <span style='font-style: italic;'>mechanistic interpretability</span> seeks to describe these transformations in human-understandable language. To date, our team’s approach has followed a two-step approach. First, we identify <span style='font-style: italic;'>features</span>, interpretable building blocks that the model uses in its computations. Second, we describe the processes, or <span style='font-style: italic;'>circuits,</span> by which these features interact to produce model outputs.</p>
<p>A natural approach is to use the raw neurons of the model as these building blocks.<d-footnote>An alternative approach is to study the roles of gross model components such as entire MLP blocks and attention heads <d-cite key="meng2022locating,wang2022interpretability,conmy2023towards"></d-cite>. This approach has identified interesting roles these components play in specific behaviors, but large components play a multitude of unrelated roles across the data distribution, so we seek a more granular decomposition.</d-footnote> Using this approach, previous work successfully identified interesting circuits in vision models, built out of neurons that appear to represent meaningful visual concepts <d-cite key="cammarata2020thread"></d-cite>. However, model neurons are often <span style='font-style: italic;'>polysemantic </span>— representing a mixture of many unrelated concepts. One reason for polysemanticity is thought to be the phenomenon of <span style='font-style: italic;'>superposition</span><span style='font-style: italic;'> </span><d-cite key="arora2018linear,goh2016decoding,elhage2022superposition"></d-cite>, in which models must represent more concepts than they have neurons, and thus must “smear” their representation of concepts across many neurons. This mismatch between the network's basic computational units (neurons) and meaningful concepts has proved a major impediment to progress to the mechanistic agenda, especially in understanding language models.</p>
<p>In recent years, sparse coding models such as sparse autoencoders (SAEs) <d-cite key="bricken2023monosemanticity,cunningham2023sparse,gao2024scaling,rajamanoharan2024jumping"></d-cite>, transcoders <d-cite key="dunefsky2024transcoders,marks2024dictionary,templeton2024predicting"></d-cite>, and crosscoders <d-cite key="lindsey2024crosscoders"></d-cite> have emerged as promising tools for identifying interpretable features represented in superposition. These methods decompose model activations into sparsely active components (“features”),<d-footnote>We use 'feature' following the tradition of 'feature detectors' in neuroscience and 'feature learning' in machine learning. Some recent literature uses the term 'latent,' which refers to specific vectors in the model's latent space. We find 'feature' better captures the computational role these elements play, making it more appropriate for describing transcoder neurons than SAE decoder vectors.</d-footnote> which turn out in many cases to correspond to human-interpretable concepts. While current sparse coding methods are an imperfect way of identifying features (see <a href='#limitations'>§&nbsp;Limitations</a>), they produce interpretable enough results that we are motivated to study <span style='font-style: italic;'>circuits</span> composed of these features. Several authors have already made promising steps in this direction <d-cite key="marks2024sparse,dunefsky2024transcoders,ge2024automatically"></d-cite>.</p>
<p>Although the basic premise of studying circuits built out of sparse coding features sounds simple, the design space is large. In this paper we describe our current approach, which involves several key methodological decisions:</p>
<ol><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'><span style='font-weight: 700;'>Transcoders.</span> We extract features using a variant of <span style='font-style: italic;'>transcoders</span> <d-cite key="dunefsky2024transcoders,templeton2024predicting"></d-cite> rather than SAEs, which allows us to construct an interpretable “replacement model” that can be studied as a proxy for the original model. Importantly, this approach allows us to analyze direct feature-feature interactions.</li><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'><span style='font-weight: 700;'>Cross-Layer.</span> We base our analysis on cross-layer transcoders (CLT) <d-cite key="lindsey2024crosscoders"></d-cite>, in which each feature reads from the residual stream at one layer and contributes to the outputs of all subsequent MLP layers of the original model, which greatly simplifies the resulting circuits. Remarkably, we can substitute our learned CLT features for the model's MLPs while matching the underlying model's outputs in ~50% of cases.</li><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'><span style='font-weight: 700;'>Attribution Graphs.</span> We focus on studying “attribution graphs” which describe the steps a model used to produce an output for a target token on a particular prompt<span style='font-style: italic;'>, </span>using an approach similar to Dunefsky et al. <d-cite key="dunefsky2024transcoders"></d-cite>. The nodes in the attribution graph represent active features, token embeddings from the prompt, reconstruction errors, and output logits. The edges in the graph represent linear effects between nodes, so the activity of each feature is the sum of its input edges (up to its activation threshold) (see <a href='#graphs'>§&nbsp;Attribution Graphs</a>).</li><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'><span style='font-weight: 700;'>Linear Attribution Between Features.</span> We design our setup so that, for a specific input, the direct interactions between features are linear. This makes attribution a well-defined, principled operation. Crucially, we freeze attention patterns and normalization denominators (following <d-cite key="nelhage2021mathematical"></d-cite>) and use transcoders to achieve this linearity.<d-footnote>Direct feature-feature interactions are linear because transcoder features “bridge over” the MLP nonlinearities, replacing their computation, and because we've frozen the remaining nonlinearities: attention patterns and normalization denominators. It's worth noting that strictly we mean that the pre-activation of a feature is linear with respect to the activations of earlier features.<br>Freezing attention patterns is a standard approach which divides understanding transformers into two steps: understanding behavior given attention patterns, and understanding why the model attends to those positions. This approach was explored in depth for attention models in <span style='font-style: italic;'>A Mathematical Framework</span> <d-cite key="nelhage2021mathematical"></d-cite>, which also <a href='https://transformer-circuits.pub/2021/framework/index.html#additional-intuition'>discussed</a> a generalization to MLP layers which is essentially the approach used in this paper<span style='font-style: italic;'>.</span> Note that factoring out understanding attention patterns in this way leads to the issues with attention noted in <a href='#limitations-attention'>§&nbsp;Limitations: Missing Attention Circuits</a>. However, we can then also take the same solution <span style='font-style: italic;'>Framework</span> takes of studying QK circuits.</d-footnote> Features also have indirect interactions, mediated by other features, which correspond to multi-step paths.</li><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'><span style='font-weight: 700;'>Pruning.</span> Although our features are sparse, there are still too many features active on a given prompt to easily interpret the resulting graph. To manage this complexity, we prune graphs by identifying the nodes and edges which most contribute to the model’s output at a specific token position (see <a href='#evaluating-graphs-pruning'>§&nbsp;Appendix: Graph Pruning</a>). Doing so allows us to produce sparse, interpretable graphs of the model’s computation for arbitrary prompts.</li><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'><span style='font-weight: 700;'>Interface.</span> We designed an interactive interface for exploring attribution graphs, and the features they're composed of, that allows a researcher to quickly identify and highlight key mechanisms within them.</li><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'><span style='font-weight: 700;'>Validation.</span> Our approach to studying circuits is indirect – our replacement model may use different mechanisms from the underlying model. Thus, it is important that we validate the mechanisms we find in attribution graphs. We do so using perturbation experiments. Specifically, we measure the extent to which applying perturbations in a feature's direction produces changes to other feature activations (and to the model's output) that are consistent with the attribution graph. We find that across prompts, perturbation experiments are generally qualitatively consistent with our attribution graphs, though there are some deviations.</li><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'><span style='font-weight: 700;'>Global Weights.</span> While our paper mostly focuses on studying attribution graphs for individual prompts, our methods also allow us to study the weights of the replacement model (“global weights”) directly, which underlie mechanisms across many prompts. In <a href='#global-weights'>§&nbsp;Global Weights</a>, we demonstrate some challenges with doing so – naive global weights are often less interpretable than attribution graphs due to weight interference. However, we successfully apply them to understand the circuits underlying small number addition.</li></ol>
<p>The goal of this paper is to describe and validate our methodology in detail, using a few case studies for illustration.</p>
<ul><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'>We begin with methods. We describe the setup of our <span style='font-style: italic;'>replacement model</span> (<a href='#building'>§&nbsp;Building an Interpretable Replacement Model</a>) and how we construct <span style='font-style: italic;'>attribution graphs</span> (<a href='#graphs'>§&nbsp;Attribution Graphs</a>), concluding with two case studies (<a href='#graphs-factual-recall'>§&nbsp;Factual Recall Case Study</a>, <a href='#graphs-addition'>§&nbsp;Addition Case Study</a>). We then go on to explore approaches to constructing <span style='font-style: italic;'>global circuits</span>, including challenges and some preliminary methods for addressing them (<a href='#global-weights'>§&nbsp;Global Weights</a>).</li></ul>
<ul><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'>We then provide a detailed quantitative evaluation of our cross-layer transcoders and the resulting attribution graphs (<a href='#evaluating'>§&nbsp;Evaluations</a>), showing metrics by which CLTs provide Pareto-improvements over neurons and per-layer transcoders. Afterwards, we provide an overview of our companion paper, in which we apply our method to various behaviors of Claude 3.5 Haiku (<a href='#biology'>§&nbsp;Biology</a>). We follow with a discussion of methodological limitations (<a href='#limitations'>§&nbsp;Limitations</a>). These include the role of attention patterns, the impact of reconstruction errors, the identification of suppression motifs, and the difficulty of understanding global circuits. Addressing these limitations, and seeing what additional model mechanisms are then revealed, is a promising direction for future work.</li></ul>
<ul><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'>We close with a broader discussion (<a href='#discussion'>§&nbsp;Discussion</a>) of the design space of methods for producing attribution graphs – parts of our approach can be freely remixed with others while retaining much of the benefit – and a review of related work (<a href='#related-work'>§&nbsp;Related Work</a>).</li><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'>Our companion paper, <span style='font-style: italic;'><a href='./biology.html'>On the Biology of a Large Language Model</a></span>, applies these methods to Claude 3.5 Haiku, investigating a diverse range of behaviors such as multiple hop reasoning, planning, and hallucinations.</li></ul>
<p>We note that training a cross-layer transcoder can incur significant up-front cost and effort, which is amortized over its application to circuit discovery. We have found that this improves circuit interpretability and parsimony enough to justify the investment (see <a href='#appendix-ml-details-plausible'>cost estimates</a> for open-weights models and <a href='#appendix-ml-details-efficiency'>discussion</a> of cost-matched performance relative to per-layer transcoders). Nevertheless, we stress that alternatives like per-layer transcoders or even MLP neurons can be used instead (keeping the same steps 3–8 above), and still produce useful insights. Moreover, it is likely that better methods than CLTs will be developed in the future. </p>
<p>To aid replication, we share guidance on CLT <a href='#appendix-ml-details'>implementation</a>, details on the <a href='#appendix-graph-pruning'>pruning method</a>, and the <a href='https://github.com/anthropics/attribution-graphs-frontend'>front-end code</a> supporting the interactive graph analysis interface.</p>

<p>A cross-layer transcoder (CLT) consists of neurons (“features”) divided into <d-math>L</d-math> layers, the same number of layers as the underlying model. The goal of the model is to reconstruct the outputs of the MLPs of the underlying model, using sparsely active features. The features receive input from the model’s residual stream at their associated layer, but are “cross-layer” in the sense that they can provide output to all subsequent layers.<d-footnote>Other architectures besides CLTs can be used for circuit analysis, but we’ve empirically found this approach to work well.</d-footnote> Concretely:</p>
<ul><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'>Each feature in the <d-math>\ell^\text{th}</d-math> layer “reads in” from the residual stream at that layer using a linear encoder followed by a nonlinearity.</li><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'>An <d-math>\ell^\text{th}</d-math> layer feature contributes to the reconstruction of the MLP outputs in layers <d-math>\ell, \ell+1,\ldots , L</d-math>, using a separate set of linear decoder weights for each output layer.</li><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'>All features in all layers are trained jointly. As a result, the output of the MLP in a layer <d-math>\ell^\prime</d-math> is jointly reconstructed by the features from all previous layers.</li></ul>
<p>More formally, to <span style='font-weight: 700;'>run</span> a cross-layer transcoder, let <d-math>\mathbf{x^{\ell}}</d-math> denote the original model’s residual stream activations at layer <d-math>\ell</d-math>. The CLT feature activations <d-math>\mathbf{a^{\ell}}</d-math> at layer <d-math>\ell</d-math> are computed as</p>
<p><d-math block>\mathbf{a^{\ell}} = \text{JumpReLU}\!\left(W_{enc}^{\ell} \mathbf{x^{\ell}}\right)</d-math></p>
<p>where <d-math>W_{enc}^{\ell}</d-math> is the CLT encoder matrix at layer <d-math>\ell</d-math>.</p>
<p>We let <d-math>\mathbf{y^{\ell}}</d-math> refer to the output of the original model’s MLP at layer <d-math>\ell</d-math>. The CLT’s attempted reconstruction <d-math>\mathbf{\hat{y}^{\ell}}</d-math> of <d-math>\mathbf{y^{\ell}}</d-math> is computed using the JumpReLU activation function <d-cite key="rajamanoharan2024jumping"></d-cite> as:</p>
<p><d-math block sub>\mathbf{\hat{y}^{\ell}} = \sum_{\ell'=1}^{\ell} W_{dec}^{\ell' \to \ell} \mathbf{a^{\ell'}}</d-math></p>
<p>where <d-math>W_{dec}^{\ell' \to \ell}</d-math> is the CLT decoder matrix for features at layer <d-math>\ell'</d-math> outputting to layer <d-math>\ell</d-math>.</p>
<p>To <span style='font-weight: 700;'>train</span> a cross-layer transcoder, we minimize a sum of two loss functions. The first is a reconstruction error loss, summed across layers:</p>
<p><d-math block sub>L_\text{MSE} = \sum_{\ell=1}^L \|\mathbf{\hat{y}^{\ell}} - \mathbf{y^{\ell}} \|^2</d-math></p>
<p>The second is a sparsity penalty (with an overall coefficient <d-math>\lambda</d-math>, a hyperparameter, and another hyperparameter <d-math>c</d-math>) summed across layers:</p>
<p><d-math block sub>L_\text{sparsity} = \lambda\sum_{\ell=1}^L \sum_{i=1}^N \textrm{tanh}(c \cdot \|\mathbf{W_{dec, i}^{\ell}}\| \cdot a^{\ell}_i)</d-math></p>
<p>Where <d-math>N</d-math> is the number of features per layer and <d-math>\mathbf{W_{dec, i}^{\ell}}</d-math> is the concatenation of all decoder vectors of feature <d-math>i</d-math>.</p>
<p>We trained CLTs of varying sizes on a small 18-layer transformer model (“18L”)<d-footnote>18L has no MLP in layer 0, so our CLT has 17 layers.</d-footnote>, and on Claude 3.5 Haiku. The total number of features across all layers ranged from 300K to 10M features (for 18L) and from 300K to 30M features (for Haiku). For more training details see <a href='#appendix-ml-details'>§&nbsp;Appendix: CLT Implementation Details</a>.</p>
<h3><a id='building-replacement' href='#building-replacement'>From Cross-Layer Transcoder to Replacement Model</a></h3>
<p>Given a trained cross-layer transcoder, we can define a “replacement model” that substitutes the cross-layer transcoder features for the model’s MLP neurons – that is, where each layer's MLP output is replaced by its reconstruction by all CLTs that write to the that layer. Running a forward pass of this replacement model is identical to running the original model, with two modifications:</p>
<ul><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'>Upon reaching the <span style='font-style: italic;'>input</span> to the MLP in layer <d-math>\ell</d-math>, we compute the activations of the cross-layer transcoder features whose encoders live in layer <d-math>\ell</d-math>.</li><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'>Upon reaching the <span style='font-style: italic;'>output</span> of the MLP in layer <d-math>\ell</d-math>, we overwrite it with the summed outputs of the cross-layer transcoder features in this and previous layers, using their decoders for layer <d-math>\ell</d-math>.</li></ul>
<p>Attention layers are applied as usual, without any freezing or modification. Although our CLTs were only trained using input activations from the underlying model, “running” the replacement model involves running CLTs on "off-distribution" input activations from intermediate activations from the replacement model itself.</p>
<div class='sn-figma-div' data-args='{"figma_slug":"overview-breakup-1-svg"}'></div>
<p>As a simple evaluation, we measure the fraction of completions for which the most likely token output of the replacement model matches that of the underlying model. The fraction improves with scale, and is better for CLTs compared to a per-layer transcoder baseline (i.e., each layer has a standard single layer transcoder trained on it; the number of features shown refers to the total number across all layers). We also compare to a baseline of thresholded neurons, varying the threshold below which neurons are zeroed out (empirically, we find that higher neuron activations are increasingly interpretable, and we indicate below where their interpretability roughly matches that of features according to our auto-evaluations in <a href='#evaluating-model-clt'>§&nbspQuantitative CLT Evaluations</a>). Our largest 18L CLT matches the underlying model’s next-token completion on 50% of a diverse set of pretraining-style prompts from an open source dataset (see <a href='#appendix-eval-details'>§&nbspAdditional Evaluation Details</a>).<d-footnote>We use a randomly sampled set of prompts and target tokens, restricting to those which the model predicts correctly, but with a confidence lower than 80% (to filter out “boring” tokens). </d-footnote></p>
<div class='sn-figma-div' data-args='{"figma_slug":"replacement-model-metrics-svg"}'></div>
<h3><a id='building-local-replacement' href='#building-local-replacement'>The Local Replacement Model</a></h3>
<p>While running the replacement model can sometimes reproduce the same outputs as the underlying model, there is still a significant gap, and reconstruction errors can compound across layers. Since we are ultimately interested in understanding the underlying model, we would like to approximate it as closely as possible. To that end, when studying a fixed prompt <d-math>p</d-math>, we construct a <span style='font-style: italic;'>local replacement model</span>, which</p>
<ul><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'>Substitutes the CLT for the MLP layers (as in the replacement model);</li><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'>Uses the attention patterns and normalization denominators from the underlying model's forward pass on <d-math>p</d-math> (as in <d-cite key="nelhage2021mathematical,dunefsky2024transcoders"></d-cite>);</li><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'>Adds an error adjustment to the CLT output at each (token position, layer) pair equal to the difference between the true MLP output on <d-math>p</d-math> and the CLT output on <d-math>p</d-math> (as in <d-cite key="marks2024sparse"></d-cite>).</li></ul>
<p>After this error adjustment and freezing of attention and normalization nonlinearities, we've effectively re-written the underlying model's computation on the prompt <d-math>p</d-math> in terms of different basic units; all of the error-corrected replacement model's activations and logit outputs exactly match those of the underlying model. However, this does not guarantee that the local replacement model and underlying model use the same <span style='font-style: italic;'>mechanisms</span>. We can measure differences in mechanism by measuring how differently these models respond to perturbations; we refer to the extent to which perturbation behavior matches as “mechanistic faithfulness”, discussed in <a href='#evaluating-model-faithfulness'>§ Evaluating Mechanistic Faithfulness</a>.<d-footnote>This is similar in spirit to a Taylor approximation of a function <d-math>f</d-math> at a point <d-math>a</d-math>; both agree locally in a neighborhood of <d-math>a</d-math> but diverge in behavior as you move away.</d-footnote></p>
<p>The local replacement model can be viewed as a very large fully connected neural network, spanning across tokens, on which we can do classic circuit analysis:</p>
<ul><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'>Its input is the concatenated set of one-hot vectors for each token in the prompt.</li><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'>Its neurons are the union of the CLT features active at every token position.</li><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'>Its weights are the summed interactions over all the linear paths from one feature to another, including via the residual stream and through attention, but not passing through MLP or CLT layers. Because attention patterns and normalization denominators are frozen, the impact of a source feature's activation on a target feature's pre-activation via each path is linear in the activation of the source feature. We sometimes refer to these as "virtual weights" because they are not instantiated in the underlying model.</li><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'>Additionally, it has bias-like nodes corresponding to error terms, with a connection from each bias to each downstream neuron in the model.</li></ul>
<p>The only nonlinearities in the local replacement model are those applied to feature preactivations.</p>
<p>The local replacement model serves as the basis of our <span style='font-style: italic;'>attribution graphs</span>, where we study the feature-feature interactions of the local replacement model on the prompt for which it was made. These graphs are the primary object of study of this paper.</p>
<div class='sn-figma-div' data-args='{"figma_slug":"overview-breakup-2-svg"}'></div>
<br><br><br><hr><br><br><h2><a id='graphs' href='#graphs'>Attribution Graphs</a></h2>
<p>We will introduce our methodology for constructing attribution graphs while working through a case study regarding the model’s ability to write acronyms for arbitrary titles. In the example we study, the model successfully completes a fictional acronym. Specifically, we give the model the prompt <span class='prompt-inline'>The National Digital Analytics Group (N</span> and sample its completion: <span class='prompt-inline'>DAG)</span>. The tokenizer the model was trained with uses a special “Caps Lock” token, which means the prompt and completion are tokenized as follows: <code>The</code> <code>National</code> <code>Digital</code> <code>Analytics</code> <code>Group</code> <code> (</code><code>⇪</code><code>n</code><code>dag</code>.</p>
<p>We explain the computation the model performs to output the “DAG” token by constructing an attribution graph showing the flow of information from the prompt through intermediary features and to that output.<d-footnote>Due to the “Caps Lock” token, the actual target token is “dag”. We write the token in uppercase here and in the rest of the text for ease of reading.</d-footnote> Below, we show a simplified diagram of the full attribution graph. The diagram shows the prompt at the bottom and the model’s completion on top. Boxes represent groups of similar features, and can be hovered over to display each feature’s visualization. We discuss our interpretation of features in <a href='#graphs-tutorial-features'>§&nbsp;Understanding and Labeling Features</a>. Arrows represent the direct effect of a group of features or a token on other features and the output logit. </p>
<div class='sn-figma-div' data-args='{"figma_slug":"ndag-graph-svg"}'></div>
<p>The graph for the acronym prompt shows three main paths, originating from each of the tokens that compose the desired acronym. Paths originate from features for a given word, promoting features about “saying the first letter of that word in the correct position”, which themselves have positive edges to a “say DAG” feature and the logit. “say X” labels describe “output features”, which promote a specific token X, and arbitrary single letters are denoted with underscores. The “Word → say _W” edges represent attention heads’ OV circuits writing to a subspace that is then amplified by MLPs at the target position. Each group of features also has a direct edge to the logit in addition to the sequential paths, representing effects mediated only via attention head OVs (i.e., paths to the output in the local replacement model that don’t “touch” another MLP layer). </p>
<p>In order to output “DAG”, the model also needs to decide to output an acronym, and to account for the fact that the prompt already contains N, and indeed we see features for “in an acronym” and “in an N at the start of an acronym” with positive edges to the logit. The word National has minimal influence on the logit. We hypothesize that this is due to its main contribution being through influencing attention patterns, which our method does not explain (see <a href='#limitations-attention'>§ Limitations: Missing Attention Circuits</a>).</p>
<p> In the rest of this section, we explain how we compute and visualize attribution graphs.</p>
<h3><a id='graphs-constructing' href='#graphs-constructing'>Constructing an Attribution Graph for a Prompt</a></h3>
<p>To interpret the computations performed by the local replacement model, we compute a causal graph that depicts the sequences of computational steps it performs on a particular prompt. The core logic by which we construct the graph is essentially the same as that of Dunefsky <span style='font-style: italic;'>et al.</span> <d-cite key="dunefsky2024transcoders"></d-cite>, extended to handle cross-layer transcoders. Our graphs contain four types of nodes:</p>
<ul><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'>The <span style='font-style: italic;'>output</span> nodes correspond to candidate output tokens. We only construct output nodes for the tokens required to reach 95% of the probability mass, up to a total of 10.<d-footnote>We chose this threshold arbitrarily. Empirically, fewer than three logits are required to capture 95% of the probability in the cases we study.</d-footnote></li><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'>The <span style='font-style: italic;'>intermediate</span> nodes correspond to active cross-layer transcoder features at each prompt token position.</li><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'>The primary <span style='font-style: italic;'>input</span> nodes of the graph correspond to the embeddings of the prompt tokens. </li><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'>Additional input nodes (“<span style='font-style: italic;'>error</span> nodes”) correspond to the portion of each MLP output in the underlying model left unexplained by the CLT.</li></ul>
<p>Edges in the graph represent direct, linear attributions in the local replacement model. Edges originate from feature, embedding, and error nodes, and terminate at feature and output nodes. Given a source feature node <d-math>s</d-math> and a target feature node <d-math>t</d-math>, the edge weight between them is defined to be <d-math>A_{s\rightarrow t} := a_sw_{s \rightarrow t}</d-math>, where <d-math>w_{s \rightarrow t}</d-math> is the (virtual) weight in the local replacement model viewed as a fully connected neural network and <d-math>a_s</d-math> is the activation of the source feature.<d-footnote>Alternatively, w_{s \rightarrow t} is the derivative of the preactivation of <d-math>t</d-math> with respect to the source feature activation, with stop-gradients on all non-linearities in the local replacement model.</d-footnote></p>
<p>In terms of the underlying model, <d-math>w_{s \rightarrow t}</d-math> is a sum over all linear paths (i.e., through attention head OVs and residual connections) connecting the source feature's decoder vectors to the target feature's encoder vector.</p>
<p>We now give details on how to efficiently compute these in practice, using backwards Jacobians. Let <d-math>s</d-math> be a source feature node at layer <d-math>\ell_s</d-math> and context position <d-math>c_s</d-math> and let <d-math>t</d-math> be a target feature node at layer <d-math>\ell_t</d-math> and context position <d-math>c_t</d-math>. We write <d-math>J_{c_s, \ell_s \rightarrow c_t, \ell_t}^{\blacktriangledown}</d-math> for the Jacobian of the underlying model with a stop-gradient operation applied to all model components with nonlinearities – the MLP outputs, the attention patterns, and normalization denominators – on a backwards pass on the prompt of interest, from the residual stream at context position <d-math>c_t</d-math> and layer <d-math>\ell_t</d-math> to the residual stream at context position <d-math>c_s</d-math> and layer <d-math>\ell_s</d-math>. The edge weight from <d-math>s</d-math> to <d-math>t</d-math> is then</p>
<p><d-math block sub>A_{s \rightarrow t} = a_s w_{s \rightarrow t} = a_s \sum_{\ell_s \leq \ell < \ell_t} (W_{\text{dec}, \;s}^{\ell_s \to \ell})^T J_{c_s, \ell \rightarrow c_t, \ell_t}^{\blacktriangledown} W_{\text{enc}, \;t}^{\ell_t},</d-math></p>
<p>where</p>
<ul><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'><d-math>W_{\text{dec}, \;s}^{\ell_s \to \ell}</d-math> is the decoder vector of the feature for <d-math>s</d-math> writing to layer <d-math>\ell</d-math>,</li><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'><d-math>W_{\text{enc}, \;t}^{\ell_t}</d-math> is the encoder vector of the feature for <d-math>s</d-math>.</li></ul>
<p>The formulas for the other edge types are similar, e.g., an embedding-feature edge weight is given by <d-math>w_{s \rightarrow t} = \text{Emb}_s^TJ_{c_s, \ell_s \rightarrow c_t, \ell_t}^{\blacktriangledown} W_{\text{enc}, \;t}^{\ell_t}</d-math>. Note that error nodes have no input edges. For all such formulas, and an expansion of the Jacobian in terms of paths in the underlying model, see <a href='#appendix-attribution-graph-computation'>§&nbsp;Appendix: Attribution Graph Computation</a>.)</p>
<p>Because we have added stop-gradients to all model nonlinearities in the computation above, the preactivation <d-math>h_t</d-math> of any feature node <d-math>t</d-math> is simply the sum of its incoming edges in the graph: <d-math>h_t = \sum_\mathcal{S_t} w_{s \rightarrow t}</d-math> where <d-math>S_t</d-math> is the set of nodes at earlier layers and equal or earlier context positions as <d-math>t</d-math>. Thus the attribution graph edges provide a linear decomposition of each feature's activity.</p>
<p>Note that these graphs do not contain information about the influence of nodes on other nodes via their influence on attention <span style='font-style: italic;'>patterns</span>, but do contain information about node-to-node influence through the <span style='font-style: italic;'>outputs</span> of frozen attention. In other words, we account for the information which flows from one token position to another, but not why the model moved that information.<d-footnote>That is, our model ignores the "QK-circuits" but captures the "OV-circuits".<d-cite key="nelhage2021mathematical"></d-cite></d-footnote> Note also that the outgoing edges from a cross-layer feature aggregate the effect of its decodings at <span style='font-style: italic;'>all </span>of the layers that it writes to on downstream features.</p>
<p>While our replacement model features are sparsely active (on the order of a hundred active features per token position), attribution graphs are too large to be viewed in full, particularly as prompt length grows – the number of edges can grow to the millions even for short prompts. Fortunately, a small subgraph typically accounts for most of the significant paths from the input to the output.</p>
<p>To identify such subgraphs, we apply a pruning algorithm designed to preserve nodes and edges that directly or indirectly exert significant influence on the logit nodes. With our default parameters, we typically reduce the number of nodes by a factor of 10, while only reducing the behavior explained by 20%. See <a href='#appendix-graph-pruning'>§&nbsp;Appendix: Graph Pruning</a> for methodological details of our algorithms and metrics.</p>
<h3><a id='graphs-tutorial' href='#graphs-tutorial'>Learning from Attribution Graphs</a></h3>
<p>Even following pruning, attribution graphs are quite information-dense. A pruned graph often contains hundreds of nodes and tens of thousands of edges – too much information to interpret all at once. To allow us to navigate this complexity, we developed an interactive attribution graphs visualization interface. The interface is designed to enable “tracing” key paths through the graph, retain the ability to revisit previously explored nodes and paths, and materialize the information needed to interpret features on an as-needed basis.</p>
<div class='sn-figma-div' data-args='{"figma_slug":"overview-ui-svg"}'></div>
<p>Below we show the interactive visualization for the attribution graph attributing back from the single token “DAG”:</p>
<div class='cg-div' style="mix-blend-mode: multiply;" data-args='{"slug":"ndag-18l"}'></div>
<p>The interface is interactive. Nodes can be hovered over and clicked on to display additional information. Subgraphs can also be constructed by using <kbd>Cmd/Ctrl+Click</kbd> to select a subset of nodes. In the subgraph, features can be aggregated into groups we call <span style='font-style: italic;'>supernodes</span> (motivated below in <a href='#graphs-tutorial-supernodes'>§ Grouping Features into Supernodes</a>).</p>
<div class='sn-figma-div' data-args='{"figma_slug":"ui-overview-breakdown-svg"}'></div>
<h3><a id='graphs-tutorial-features' href='#graphs-tutorial-features'>Understanding and Labeling Features</a></h3>
<p>We use feature visualizations similar to those shown in our previous work, <a href='https://transformer-circuits.pub/2024/scaling-monosemanticity/index.html'>Scaling Monosemanticity</a>, in order to manually interpret and label individual features in our graph.<d-footnote>We sometimes used labels from our automated interpretability pipeline as a starting point, but generally found human labels to be more reliable.</d-footnote></p>
<p>The easiest features to label are input features, which activate on specific tokens or categories of closely-related tokens and which are common in early layers, and output features, which promote continuing the response with specific tokens or categories of closely-related tokens and which are common in late layers. For example:</p>
<ul><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'><span class='fh-span' data-args='18l__b13069339'>This feature</span> is likely an input feature because its visualization shows that it activates strongly on the word “digital” and similar words like “digitize”, but not on other words. We therefore label it a “digital” feature.</li><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'><span class='fh-span' data-args='h35__b19825041'>This feature</span> (a Haiku feature from the later <a href='#graphs-addition'>§&nbsp;Addition Case Study</a>) is an input feature that activates on a variety of tokens that end in the digit 6, and even on tokens that are more abstractly related to 6 like “six” and “June”.</li><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'><span class='fh-span' data-args='18l__b16424601'>This feature</span> is likely an output feature because it activates strongly on several different tokens, but in each example, the token is followed by the text “dag”. Furthermore, the top of the visualization indicates that the feature increases the probability of the model predicting “dag” more than any other token (in terms of its direct effect through the residual stream). This suggests that it’s an output feature. Since output features are common, when labeling output features that promote some token or category X, we often simply write “say X”, so we give this example the label “say ‘dag’”.</li><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'><span class='fh-span' data-args='18l__b9744180'>This feature</span> (from the later <a href='#graphs-factual-recall'>§&nbsp;Factual Recall Case Study</a>) is an output feature that promotes a variety of sports, though it also demonstrates some ways in which labeling output features can be difficult. For example, one must observe that “lac” is the first token of “lacrosse”. Also, the next token in the context after the feature activates often isn’t actually the name of a sport, but is usually a plausible place for the name of a sport to go.</li></ul>
<p>Other features, which are common in middle layers of the model, are more abstract and require more work to label. We may use examples of contexts they are active over, their <span style='font-style: italic;'>logit effects</span> (the tokens they directly promote and suppress through the residual stream and unembedding), and the features they’re connected to in order to label them. For example:</p>
<ul><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'><span class='fh-span' data-args='18l__b13802533'>This feature</span> activates on the first one or two letters of an unfinished acronym after an open parenthesis, for a variety of letters and acronyms, so we label it as continuing an acronym in general.</li><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'><span class='fh-span' data-args='18l__b27339305'>This feature</span> activates at the start of a variety of acronyms that all have D as their <span style='font-style: italic;'>second</span> letter, and many of the tokens it promotes directly have D as their second letter as well. (Not all of those tokens do, but we don’t expect logit effects to perfectly represent the feature’s functionality because of indirect effects through the rest of the model. We also find that features further away from the last layer have less interpretable logit effects.) For brevity, we may label this feature as “say ‘_D’”, representing the first letter with an underscore.</li><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'>Finally, <span class='fh-span' data-args='18l__b21590055'>this feature</span> activates on the first letter of various strings of uppercase letters that don’t seem to be acronyms, and the tokens it most suppresses are acronym-like letters, but its examples otherwise lack an obvious commonality, so we tentatively label it as suppressing acronyms.</li></ul>
<p>We find that even imperfect labels for these features allow us to find significant structure in the graphs.</p>
<h3><a id='graphs-tutorial-supernodes' href='#graphs-tutorial-supernodes'>Grouping Features into Supernodes</a></h3>
<p>Attribution graphs often contain groups of features which share a facet relevant to their role on the prompt. For example, there are <span class='fh-span' data-args='18l__b13069339_b6968304_b7420431'>three features</span> active on “Digital” in our prompt which each respond to the word “digital” in different cases and contexts. The only facet which matters for this prompt is that the word “digital” starts with a “D”; all three features have positive edges to the same set of downstream nodes. Thus for the purposes of analyzing this prompt, it makes sense to group these features together and treat them as a unit. For the purposes of visualization and analysis, we find it convenient to group multiple nodes — corresponding to (feature, context position) pairs — into a “supernode.” These supernodes correspond to the boxes in the simplified schematic we showed above, reproduced below for convenience.</p>
<div class='sn-figma-div' data-args='{"figma_slug":"ndag-graph-svg"}'></div>
<p>The strategy we use to group nodes depends on the analysis at hand, and on the roles of the features in a given prompt. We sometimes group features which activate over similar contexts, have similar embedding or logit effects, or have similar input/output edges, depending on the facet which is important for the claim we are making about the mechanism. We generally want nodes within a supernode to promote each other, and their effects on downstream nodes to have the same sign. While we experimented with automated strategies such as clustering based on decoder vectors or the graph adjacency matrix, no automated method was sufficient to cover the range of feature groupings required to illustrate certain mechanistic claims. We further discuss supernodes and potential reasons for why they are needed in <a href='#appendix-dupe-features'>Similar Features and Supernodes</a>.</p>
<h3><a id='graphs-interventions' href='#graphs-interventions'>Validating Attribution Graph Hypotheses with Interventions</a></h3>
<p>In attribution graphs, nodes suggest which features matter for a model's output, and edges suggest how they matter. We can validate the claims of an attribution graph by performing feature perturbations in the underlying model, and checking if the effects on downstream features or on the model outputs match our predictions based on the graph. Features can be intervened on by modifying their computed activation and injecting its modified decoding in lieu of the original reconstruction.</p>
<p>Features in a cross-layer transcoder write to multiple output layers, so we need to decide on a range of layers in which to perform our intervention. How might we do this? We could intervene on a feature’s decoding at a single layer just like we would for a per-layer transcoder, but edges in an attribution graph represent the cumulative effect of multiple layers’ decodings, so intervening at a single layer would only target a subset of a given edge. In addition, we’ll often want to intervene on more than one feature at a time, and different features in a supernode will decode to different layers. </p>
<p>To perform interventions over layer ranges, we modify the decoding of a feature at each layer in the given range, and run a forward pass starting from the last layer in the range. Since we aren’t recomputing a layer’s MLP output based on the result of interventions earlier in the range, the only change to the model’s MLP outputs will be our intervention. We call this approach “constrained patching”, as it doesn’t allow an intervention to have second-order effects within its patching range. See <a href='#appendix-patching'>§&nbsp;Appendix: Iterative Patching</a> for a description of another approach we call “iterative patching”, and see <a href='#appendix-cross-layer-steering'>§&nbsp;Appendix: Nuances of Steering with Cross-Layer Features</a> for a discussion of why more naive approaches, such as adding a feature’s decoder vector at each layer during a forward pass of the model, risk double counting a feature's effect.</p>
<p>Below, we illustrate a multiplicative version of constrained patching, in which we multiply a target feature’s activation by <d-math>M</d-math> in the <d-math>[\ell - 1, \ell]</d-math> layer range. Note that MLP outputs at further layers are not directly affected by the patch.<d-footnote>They can be indirectly affected since they sit downstream of affected nodes.</d-footnote></p>
<div class='sn-figma-div' data-args='{"figma_slug":"crosscoder-patching-tutorial-svg"}'></div>
<p>Attribution graphs are constructed by using the underlying model’s attention patterns, so edges in the graph do not account for effects mediated via QK circuits. Similarly, in our perturbation experiments, we keep attention patterns fixed at the values observed during an unperturbed forward pass. This methodological choice means our results don't account for how perturbations might have altered the attention patterns themselves.</p>
<p>Returning to our acronym prompt, we show the results of patching supernodes, starting with suppressing the <span class='fh-span' data-args='18l__b8222859_b13121260_b4697708'>“Group” supernode</span>. Below, we overlay patching effects onto supernode schematics for clarity, displaying the effect on other supernodes and the logit distribution. Note that in this diagram, the position of the nodes in the figure is not meant to correspond to token positions unless explicitly noted.</p>
<div class='sn-figma-div' data-args='{"figma_slug":"ndag-interventions-svg"}'></div>
<p>We now show the results of suppressing some supernodes on the aggregate activation of other supernodes and on the logit. For each patch, we set every feature in a node’s activation to be the opposite of its original value (or equivalently, we steer multiplicatively with a factor of −1).<d-footnote>For a discussion of why we steer negatively instead of ablating the feature, see <a href='#appendix-unexplained-var'>§&nbsp;Unexplained Variance and Choice of Steering Factors</a>.</d-footnote> We then plot each node’s total activation as a fraction of its original value.<d-footnote>For each patched supernode, we choose the end-layer range which causes the largest suppression effect on the logit.</d-footnote> We use an orange outline to highlight nodes downstream of one another for which we would hypothesize patching to have an effect.</p>
<div class='sn-figma-div' data-args='{"figma_slug":"patching-ndag-svg"}'></div>
<p>We see that inhibiting features for each word inhibits the related initial features in turn. In addition, the supernode of features for <span class='fh-span' data-args='18l__b5477227_b29852699'>“say DA_”</span> is affected by inhibitions of both the <span class='fh-span' data-args='18l__b13069339_b6968304_b7420431_b19785252'>“Digital”</span> and <span class='fh-span' data-args='18l__b20190866_b5736269_b7683371_b2834781'>“Analytics”</span> supernodes.</p>
<h3><a id='graphs-per-layer' href='#graphs-per-layer'>Localizing Important Layers</a></h3>
<p>The attribution graph also allows us to identify in which layers a feature’s decoding will have the greatest downstream effect on the logit. For example, the “Analytics” supernode features mostly contribute to the “dag” logit indirectly through intermediate groups of features <span class='fh-span' data-args='18l__b15808787_b27769861_b67082'>“say _A”</span>, <span class='fh-span' data-args='18l__b5477227_b29852699'>“say DA_”</span>, and <span class='fh-span' data-args='18l__b16424601'>“say DAG”</span> which live in layers 13 and beyond. </p>
<div class='cg-div' style="mix-blend-mode: multiply;" data-args='{"slug":"ndag-18l-analytics"}'></div>
<p>We would thus expect steering negatively on an “Analytics” feature to have an effect on the <span class='prompt-inline'>dag</span> logit which plateaus before layer 13 and then decreases in magnitude as we approach the final layer. The decrease is caused by the constrained nature of our intervention. If a patching range includes all the “say an acronym” features, it will not change their activation, because constrained patching doesn’t allow knock-on effects. Below, we show the effect of steering with each Analytics feature, keeping the start layer set to 1 and sweeping over the patching end layer.<d-footnote>Note that we use a large steering factor in this experiment. For a discussion of this, see <a href='#appendix-unexplained-var'>§&nbsp;Unexplained Variance and Choice of Steering Factors</a>.</d-footnote></p>

<h3><a id='graphs-factual-recall' href='#graphs-factual-recall'>Factual Recall Case Study</a></h3>
<p>We now turn to the question of factual recall by studying how the model completes <span class='prompt-inline'>Fact: Michael Jordan plays the sport of</span> with <span class='prompt-inline'>basketball</span> with 65% confidence <d-cite key="nanda2023factualrecall,batson2024easy"></d-cite>.

We group semantically similar features into supernodes like we did for the acronym study. </p>
<p>The supernode diagram below shows two primary paths. One path originates from the “plays” and “sport” tokens and promotes “sport” and “say a sport” features, which in turn promote the logits for basketball, football, and other sports. The other path originates from “Michael Jordan and other celebrities” and promotes basketball related features, which have positive edges to the basketball logit and negative edges to the football logit. In addition to these sequential paths, some groups of features such as “Michael Jordan” and “sport/game of” have direct edges to the basketball logit, representing effects mediated only via attention head OVs, consistent with the findings of Batson <span style='font-style: italic;'>et al. </span><d-cite key="batson2024easy"></d-cite>.</p>

Note that we choose to include some polysemantic features in supernodes as long as they share a facet relevant to the prompt, such as this <span class='fh-span' data-args='18l__b18022340'>feature</span> which activates more strongly on the word “synergy” than on “Michael Jordan”. We evaluate features in more depth in <a href='#evaluating-model-features'>Qualitative Feature Evaluations</a>.</p>

In addition, we see that suppressing the intermediate <span class='fh-span' data-args='18l__b7032707_b8356976_b13464407_b4737369_b16708274_b10901930'>“basketball discussion”</span> supernode also has a large effect on the logit.</p>
<h3><a id='graphs-addition' href='#graphs-addition'>Addition Case Study</a></h3>
<p>We now consider the simple addition prompt <span class='prompt-inline'>calc: 36+59=</span>. <d-footnote>We use the prefix "calc:" because the 18L performs much better on the problem with it. This prefix is not necessary for Haiku 3.5, but we include it nevertheless for the purposes of direct comparison in later sections.</d-footnote> Unlike previous sections, we show results for Haiku 3.5 because the patterns are clearer and show the same structure (see <a href='#appendix-arithmetic-comparison'>§&nbsp;Appendix: Comparison of Addition Features …</a> for a side-by-side comparison). We look at small-number addition because it is one of the simplest behaviors exhibited competently by most LLMs and human adults (try the problem in your head to see if your approach matches the model's!).</p>
<p>We supplement the generic feature visualization (on arbitrary dataset examples) with one which explicitly covers the set of two-digit addition problems, allowing us to get a crisp picture of what each feature does. Following Nikankin <span style='font-style: italic;'>et. al.</span> <d-cite key="nikankin2024arithmetic"></d-cite>, who analyzed neurons, we visualize each feature active on the <span class='prompt-inline'>=</span> token with three plots:</p>
<ul><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'>An operand plot, displaying its activity on the 100 × 100 grid of potential inputs.</li><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'>An output weight plot, displaying its direct weights on the outputs for [0, 99].<d-footnote>During analysis we visualize effects on [0, 999]. This is important to understand effects beyond the first 100 number tokens (e.g., the feature predicting 95 mod 100), but we only show [0, 99] for simplicity.</d-footnote></li><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'>An embedding weight plot (or “de-embedding” <d-cite key="dunefsky2024transcoders"></d-cite>), displaying the direct effect of embedding vectors on a feature’s encoder. This is shown in the same format as the output weight plot.</li></ul>
<p>We show an example plot of each of these three types below for different features. On this restricted domain, the operand plots are complete descriptions of the CLT features as functions. Stripes and grids in these plots represent different kinds of structure (e.g. diagonal lines indicate constraints on the sum, while grids represent modular constraints on the inputs).</p>
<div class='sn-figma-div' data-args='{"figma_slug":"operand-plots-explainer-svg"}'></div>
<p>In the supernode diagram below, we see information flow from input features, which split out the final digit, the number, and the magnitude of the operands to three major paths: a final-digit path (mod 10) (light-brown, right), a moderate precision path (middle), and a low precision path (dark brown, left),<d-footnote>With hover you can see the variability in the precision of the low precision lookup table features and the moderate precision sum features.</d-footnote> which collectively produce a moderate precision value of the sum and the final digit of the sum; these finally constructively interfere to give both the mod 100 version of the sum and the final output.</p>
<div class='sn-figma-div' data-args='{"figma_slug":"36-59-svg"}'></div>
<p>We provide the equivalent interactive graph for 18L <a href='./static_js/attribution_graphs/index.html?slug=calc-36-plus-59-18l'>here</a>.</p>
<p>The supernode graph suggests a taxonomy of features underlying this task, in which features vary along two major axes:<d-footnote>As in other sections of this work, we apply these labels manually.</d-footnote></p>
<ul><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'><span style='font-weight: 700;'>Computational </span><span style='font-weight: 700;'>role</span></li></ul>
<ul><li style='margin-left: 72pt;'><span style='font-weight: 700;'>Sum features</span> have diagonal operand plots, and fire on pairs of inputs whose sum satisfies some condition.</li><li style='margin-left: 72pt;'><span style='font-weight: 700;'>Lookup Table Features</span> have plots that look like a grid, and consist of inputs a and b satisfying <code>condition1(a) AND condition2(b)</code>. We discuss these in more detail below.</li><li style='margin-left: 72pt;'><span style='font-weight: 700;'>Add Function Features</span> have plots with horizontal or vertical bars. One addend satisfies some condition, or an <code>OR</code> operation merges two conditions across addends.</li><li style='margin-left: 72pt;'><span style='font-weight: 700;'>Mostly Active Features</span> are active on the "=" token of most of our 10,000 addition prompts.</li><li style='margin-left: 72pt;'><span style='font-weight: 700;'>Miscellaneous Features</span> have all sorts of strange properties, but often look like hybrid activation patterns from the above types. We find that these have lower influence on the outputs.</li></ul>
<ul><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'><span style='font-weight: 700;'>Condition properties</span></li></ul>
<ul><li style='margin-left: 72pt;'><span style='font-weight: 700;'>Precision</span>: we find conditions with ones-digit precision (<span class='fh-span' data-args='h35__b14881010'>sum=_5</span> or <span class='fh-span' data-args='h35__b8284534'>=59</span>), with exact range (of width e.g. 2 or 10), and with fuzzy ranges of width ranging from 2–50.</li><li style='margin-left: 72pt;'><span style='font-weight: 700;'>Modularity</span>: we find features that are sensitive to the sum or operand value in absolute terms, mod 10, mod 100, and less commonly, mod 2, mod 5, mod 25, and mod 50.</li><li style='margin-left: 72pt;'><span style='font-weight: 700;'>Pattern</span>: we find features sensitive to a regex style pattern in an input or output, such as “starts with 51”, as in <d-cite key="nikankin2024arithmetic"></d-cite>. These do not feature as prominently in our addition graphs, having low influence on the model's output, but they do exist, and may be more important for other tasks involving numbers.</li></ul>
<div class='sn-figma-div' data-args='{"figma_slug":"small-feature-taxonomy-svg"}'></div>
<p>These findings broadly agree with other mechanistic studies showing that language models trained on natural language corpora perform addition using parallel heuristics involving magnitudes and moduli that constructively interfere to produce the correct answer <d-cite key="nikankin2024arithmetic,kantamneni2025trig,zhou2024pre"></d-cite>. Namely, Nikankin et al. <d-cite key="nikankin2024arithmetic"></d-cite> proposed a “bag of heuristics” interpretation, recognizing a set of “operand” features (equivalent to our “add X” features) and “result” features (equivalent to our “sum” features) exhibiting high- and low-precision and different modularities in sensing the input and producing the output.</p>
<p>We also identify the existence of lookup table features, which seem to be an interesting consequence of the architecture used by both the model and the CLT. Neurons and CLT feature activations are computed by applying a nonlinearity to the sum of their inputs. This produces a “parallelogram constraint” on the response of a feature to a set of inputs: namely, if a feature <d-math>f</d-math> is active on two inputs of the form <d-math>x+y</d-math> and <d-math>z+w</d-math>, then it must be active on at least one of the inputs <d-math>x+w</d-math> or <d-math>z+y</d-math>. This follows since the preactivation of <d-math>f</d-math> is an affine function of the operands.<d-footnote>Write <d-math>f_{pre}</d-math> for the preactivation of <d-math>x</d-math>. Then <d-math>f_{pre}(x + y) + f_{pre}(z + w) = f_{pre}(x + w) + f_{pre}(y + z)</d-math>. If both terms on the LHS are positive, at least one on the right must be.</d-footnote> In particular, it is impossible for input features to produce a general sum feature in one step. For example, a general “sum = 5” feature which fires for 1+4 and 2+3 would need to fire for at least one of 1+3 or 2+4. So some intermediate step between copying over information about both inputs to the “=” token and producing a property of their sum is required. CLT lookup table features represent these intermediate steps for addition.<d-footnote>Concretely, the intermediate info is the ones digit produced from adding the ones digit of the operands and the approximate magnitude of the sum of two numbers in the 20s.</d-footnote></p>
<p>To validate that the structure we observe in the attribution graph matches the causal structure of the model, we perform a series of interventions. For each supernode, we perturb it to the negative of its original value, and measure the result on all subsequent supernodes and the outputs. We find results largely consistent with the graph:</p>
<div class='sn-figma-div' data-args='{"figma_slug":"patching-arithmetic-svg"}'></div>
<p>In particular, inhibiting the ones-digit feature on either of the input tokens suppresses the entire ones-digit pathway (the <span class='fh-span' data-args='h35__b12406787_b6290003'>_6 + _9</span> lookup table features, the resulting <span class='fh-span' data-args='h35__b14881010'>sum=_5</span> and <span class='fh-span' data-args='h35__b10466709_b25175771'>sum= _95</span> features), while leaving the magnitude pathway mostly intact, including the <span class='fh-span' data-args='h35__b26828964_b24405931_b28037773_b14367779'>sum~92</span> features. Remarkably, when suppressing <span class='fh-span' data-args='h35__b19825041'>_6</span>, the model confidently outputs <span class='prompt-inline'>98</span> instead of the correct answer <span class='prompt-inline'>95</span>; the tens digit from the original problem is preserved by the other magnitude signals but the ones digit is that which would result from adding 9 to itself. (Suppressing <span class='fh-span' data-args='h35__b605978'>_9</span>, however, results in an output of <span class='prompt-inline'>91</span>, not <span class='prompt-inline'>92</span>, so such numerology must be taken with a grain of salt.). Conversely, inhibiting low-precision features on either inputs (<span class='fh-span' data-args='h35__b10068234'>~30</span> and <span class='fh-span' data-args='h35__b12936589'>~59</span>) suppress the low-precision lookup table features, the magnitude sum feature, and the appropriate sum features while leaving the ones-digit pathway alone.</p>
<p>We also show the quantitative effects of perturbations on the outputs, finding that negatively steering the <span class='fh-span' data-args='h35__b12406787_b6290003'>_6 + _9</span> lookup table features smears the result out over a range of 5, while negatively steering the final <span class='fh-span' data-args='h35__b10466709_b25175771'>sum=_95</span> feature smears the result out to a wider band (perhaps coming from <span class='fh-span' data-args='h35__b26828964_b24405931_b28037773_b14367779'>sum~92</span> features).</p>
<div class="sn-figma-div" data-args="{'figma_slug':'arithmetic-logit-perturb-svg'}"></div>
<p>We will investigate how CLT features interact across the full range of two-digit addition prompts below, after establishing the framework for global weights that we use to generalize this circuit to other inputs.</p>
<br><br><br><hr><br><br><h2><a id='global-weights' href='#global-weights'>Global Weights</a></h2>
<p>The attribution graphs we construct show how features interact on a specific prompt to produce the model's output, but we are also interested in a more global picture of how features interact across all contexts. In a classic multi-layer perceptron, the global interactions are provided by the weights of the model: the direct influence of one neuron on another is just the weight between them if the neurons are in consecutive layers; if neurons are further apart, the influence of one on another factors through intermediate layers. In our setup, the interaction between features has a context <span style='font-style: italic;'>independent</span> component and a context <span style='font-style: italic;'>dependent</span> component. We would ideally like to capture both: we want a set of <span style='font-style: italic;'>global</span> <span style='font-style: italic;'>weights</span> which are context independent<span style='font-style: italic;'>,</span> but also capture network behavior across all possible contexts. In this section we analyze the context independent component (a kind of “virtual weight”), a problem with them (large “interference” terms with no causal effect on distribution), and one approach using co-activation statistics to deal with the interference.</p>
<p>On a specific prompt, a source CLT feature (<d-math>s</d-math>) influences a target (<d-math>t</d-math>) via three kinds of paths:</p>
<ol><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'>residual-direct: <d-math>s</d-math>’s decoders write to the residual stream, where it is read in at a later layer by <d-math>t</d-math>’s encoder.</li><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'>attention-direct: <d-math>s</d-math>’s decoders write to the residual stream, are transported by some number of attention head OV steps, and then read by <d-math>t</d-math>’s encoder.</li><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'>indirect: paths from <d-math>s</d-math> to <d-math>t</d-math> are mediated by other CLT features.</li></ol>
<p>We note that the residual-direct influence is simply the product of the first feature's activation on this prompt times a <a href='https://transformer-circuits.pub/2021/framework/index.html#virtual-weights'>virtual weight</a> which is consistent across inputs.<d-footnote>The attention-direct terms can also be written in terms of virtual weights given by multiplying various decoder vectors by a series of attention head OVs, and then by an encoder, but these get scaled on a prompt by both the source feature activation and the attention patterns, which make their analysis more complex.</d-footnote> These virtual weights are a simple form of global weights because of this consistent relationship. Virtual weights have been derived between many different components in neural networks, including attention heads <d-cite key="nelhage2021mathematical"></d-cite>, SAE features <d-cite key="bricken2023monosemanticity,kissane2024attention"></d-cite>, and transcoder features <d-cite key="dunefsky2024transcoders"></d-cite>. For CLTs, the virtual weight between two features is the inner product between the encoder of the downstream feature and the sum of decoders in between these two features.</p>
<p>More formally, let <d-math>\ell_s</d-math> and <d-math>\ell_t</d-math> be the layers of the encoder weights for features <d-math>s</d-math> and <d-math>t</d-math>. Let <d-math>L_{st} </d-math> be the set of layers in between these features such that <d-math> \forall \ell \in L_{st}, s \leq \ell < t</d-math>. Feature <d-math>s</d-math> writes to all MLP outputs in <d-math>L_{st}</d-math> before reaching feature <d-math>t</d-math>. Let <d-math>W_{\text{dec}}^{s,\ell}</d-math> be the decoder weights for feature <d-math>s</d-math> targeting layer <d-math>\ell</d-math>, and <d-math>W_{\text{enc}}^t</d-math> be the encoder weights for feature <d-math>t</d-math>. Then, the virtual weights are computed as: <d-math block sub> V_{st} = \big< \sum_{\ell \in L_{st}} W_{\text{dec}}^{s,\ell}, W_{\text{enc}}^t \big></d-math> Attribution graph edges consist of a sum of the residual-direct contribution (the virtual weight multiplied by a feature’s activation) plus the attention-direct contribution.</p>
<p>There is one major problem with interpreting virtual weights: interference <d-cite key="elhage2022superposition,henighan2023superposition"></d-cite>. Because millions of features are interacting via the residual stream, they will all be connected, and features which never activate together on-distribution can still have (potentially large) virtual weights between them. When this happens, the virtual weights are not suitable global weights because these connections never impact network function.</p>
<p>We can see interference at play in the following example: below, we take a “Say a game name” feature in 18L and plot its largest virtual weights by magnitude. Green bars indicate a positive connection and purple bars indicate a negative one. Many of the most strongly-connected features are hard to interpret or not clearly related to the concept.</p>
<div class="sn-figma-div" data-args="{'figma_slug':'vw-only-svg'}"></div>
<p>You might consider this a sign that virtual weights or our CLTs aren’t capturing interpretable connections. However, we can still uncover many interpretable connections by trying to remove interference from these weights.<d-footnote>We also see interference weights when looking at a larger sample of features in the <a href='#appendix-interference-weights'>§&nbsp;Appendix: Interference Weights over More FeaturesAppendix</a>.</d-footnote></p>
<p>There are two basic solutions to this problem. One is to restrict the set of features being studied to those active on a small domain (as we do in <a href='#global-weights-addition'>§&nbsp;Global Weights in Addition</a>). The other is to bring in information about the feature-feature coactivation on the data distribution.</p>
<p>For example, let <d-math>a_i</d-math> be the activation for feature <d-math>i</d-math>. We can compute an expected residual attribution value by multiplying the virtual weight as follows. <d-math block> V_{ij}^{\text{ERA}} = \mathbb{E}\big[ {\small 1}\kern{-0.33em}1(a_j > 0)V_{ij}a_i \big] = \mathbb{E}\big[ {\small 1}\kern{-0.33em}1(a_j > 0)a_i \big] V_{ij} </d-math> This represents the average strength of a residual-direct path across all of the prompts we’ve analyzed (also computed by Dunefsky et al. <d-cite key="dunefsky2024transcoders"></d-cite>). This is similar to computing the average of all attribution graphs within a context position across many tokens.<d-footnote>It only represents the residual-direct component and does not include the attention-direct one.</d-footnote> The indicator function in this expression (<d-math>{\small 1}\kern{-0.33em}1(a_j > 0)</d-math>) captures how attributions are only positive when the target feature is active. As small feature activations are often polysemantic, we instead weight attributions using the target activation value: <d-math block> V_{ij}^{\text{TWERA}} = \frac{\mathbb{E}\big[a_ja_i\big]}{\mathbb{E}\big[ a_j \big]} V_{ij} </d-math> We call this last type of weight target-weighted expected residual attribution (TWERA). As shown in the equations, both of these values can be computed by multiplying the original virtual weights by (“on-distribution”) statistics of activations.</p>
<p>Now, we revisit the example game feature from before but with connections ordered by TWERA. We also plot each connection’s “raw” virtual weight for comparison. Many more of these connections are interpretable, suggesting that the virtual weights extracted useful signals but we needed to remove the interference in order to see them. The most interpretable features from the virtual weight plot above (another “Say a game name” and “Ultimate frisbee” feature) are preserved while many unrelated concepts are filtered out.</p>
<div class="sn-figma-div" data-args="{'figma_slug':'vw-twea-svg'}"></div>
<p>TWERA is not a perfect solution for interference. Comparing TWERA values to the raw virtual weights shows that many extremely small virtual weights have strong TWERA values. <d-footnote> Note that these weights cannot be 0 as this would also send TWERA to 0.</d-footnote> This indicates that TWERA heavily relies on the coactivation statistics and strongly changes which connections are important beyond simply removing the large interference weights. TWERA also does not handle inhibition well (like attribution generally). We will explore these issues further in future work.</p>
<p>Still, we find that global weights give us a useful window into how features behave in a broader range of contexts than our attribution graphs. We’ll use these methods to complement our understanding in the rest of this paper and in <a href='./biology.html'>the companion paper</a>.</p>
<h3><a id='global-weights-addition' href='#global-weights-addition'>Global Weights in Addition</a></h3>
<p>We now return to the simple addition problem from <a href='#graphs-addition'>above</a> on Haiku 3.5, and show how data-independent virtual weights reveal clear structure between the types in our taxonomy of addition features. We again consider completions of the 10,000 prompts <span class='prompt-inline'>calc: a+b=</span> for <span style='font-weight: 700;'>a</span>,<span style='font-weight: 700;'>b</span> ∈ [0, 99]. In addition to the operand plots (again, defined <a href='#graphs-addition'>above</a>), we inspect the virtual weight graph after restricting the large <d-math>n_\text{feat} \times n_\text{feat}</d-math> virtual weight matrix to the set which are active on at least 10 of the set of 10,000 addition prompts. This allows us to see all the feature-feature interactions that can occur via direct residual paths.</p>
<p>In the neighborhood of the features appearing in the 36+59 prompt above, we see:</p>
<ul><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'>The <span class='fh-span' data-args='h35__b12406787_b6290003'>_6 + _9</span> lookup table features feed into other sum features (<span class='fh-span' data-args='h35__b19325795'>sum=_15</span>, <span class='fh-span' data-args='h35__b13996967'>sum=_25</span>, etc.), which likely activate when combined with other magnitude features.</li><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'>The <span class='fh-span' data-args='h35__b16668051'>add _9</span> feature feeds into other ones-digit lookup table features, (<span class='fh-span' data-args='h35__b24589983'>_9 + _9</span>, <span class='fh-span' data-args='h35__b27606393'>_0 + _9</span>, etc.).</li><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'>The <span class='fh-span' data-args='h35__b14881010'>sum = _5</span> feature is fed by other lookup table features.</li><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'>The medium-precision <span class='fh-span' data-args='h35__b8229363'>~36+60</span> lookup table feature is fed by an <span class='fh-span' data-args='h35__b6212049'>add ~62</span> feature in addition to the <span class='fh-span' data-args='h35__b5685156'>add ~57</span> feature we see on this prompt.</li></ul>
<div class="sn-figma-div" data-args="{'figma_slug':'global-circuit-svg'}"></div>
<p>We provide an <a href='./static_js/addition/index.html'>interactive interface</a> to explore the virtual weights connecting all 2931 features prominent on two-digit addition problems in our smaller 18L model.</p>
<p>We find that restricting to features active on this narrow domain of addition problems produces a global circuit graph where most edges are interpretable in terms of the operand function realized by the source and target features. Moreover, the connections between features recapitulate a more general version of the graph in the previous section; add features detect a specific operand as part of the input, lookup table features propagate this information to sum features which (in concert with the previous features) produce the model’s final answer.</p>
<p>Several of the features we find take the form of heuristics as in Nikankin et al. <d-cite key="nikankin2024arithmetic"></d-cite>: features whose operand plots have predictive power directly push that prediction to the outputs: the low precision features promote outputs in the range matching their operands; the ones digit lookup table features directly promote outputs matching their mappings (e.g. <span class='fh-span' data-args='h35__b12406787'>_6 + _9</span> directly upweights _5 outputs). Almost none of these features represent the full solution until the very last layers of the model. As viewed by CLTs, the models use several intermediate heuristics rather than a coherent procedural program with a single confident output.</p>
<p>Our focus on the <span style='font-style: italic;'>computational</span> steps the model uses to perform addition is complementary to concurrent work by Kantamneni and Tegmark <d-cite key="kantamneni2025trig"></d-cite> which begins from <span style='font-style: italic;'>representations</span>. Inspired by the observation of spikes in the Fourier decomposition of the embedding vectors for integers, they find low-dimensional subspaces highly correlated with numbers' magnitudes and mod 2, 5, 10, and 100 components. Projecting to those subspaces preserves much of the model's performance on the task, consistent with a “Clock” algorithm performing separate calculations in each modulus, which interfere constructively at the end; the CLT features show essentially high- and low-precision versions of that method. Some of the important features we find have operand plots similar to their neurons, which they fit as a (thresholded) sum of Fourier modes.<d-footnote>There's no guarantee that the CLT features are the most parsimonious way to split up the computation, and it's possible some of our less important, roughly-periodic features which are harder to interpret are artifacts of the periodic aspects of the representation.</d-footnote> Some of the important features appearing in our graphs (such as operands or sums that <span style='font-style: italic;'>start</span> with fixed digits, e.g. <span class='fh-span' data-args='h35__b18845922'>95_</span> and <span class='fh-span' data-args='h35__b14367779'>9_</span>) aren't describable in Fourier terms, consistent with the existence of some error in their low-rank approximation.<d-footnote>In <a href='#appendix-full-number-weights'>§&nbsp;Appendix: Number Output Weights over More Features</a>, we show output weight plots for the <span class='fh-span' data-args='h35__b14367779'>9_</span> and <span class='fh-span' data-args='h35__b18845922'>95_</span> features on all number predictions from [0,999]. We also show a miscellaneous feature that promotes <span class='fh-span' data-args='h35__b1061164'>“simple numbers”</span>: small numbers, multiples of 100 and a few standouts like 360.</d-footnote> Identifying the representational basis of the ensemble of computational strategies revealed by our unsupervised approach is a promising direction for future work.</p>
<p>Altogether, we’ve replicated a view of the base model using heuristics finding matching CLT features, we’ve shown how these heuristics contribute to separable pathways through intervention experiments, and we've demonstrated how these heuristics are connected, building off one another to collectively solve the addition task.</p>
<br><br><br><hr><br><br><h2><a id='evaluating' href='#evaluating'>Evaluations</a></h2>
<p>In this section, we perform qualitative and quantitative evaluations of transcoder features and the attribution graphs derived from them, focusing especially on <span style='font-style: italic;'>interpretability</span> and <span style='font-style: italic;'>sufficiency</span>. For readers interested in a higher level discussion of findings and limitations, we recommend skipping ahead to <a href='#biology'>§&nbsp;Biology</a> and <a href='#limitations'>§&nbsp;Limitations</a>. </p>
<p>Our methods produce causal graph descriptions of the model’s mechanisms on a particular prompt. How can we quantify how well these descriptions capture what is really going on in the model? It is difficult to distill this question to one number, as several factors are relevant:</p>
<p><span style='font-weight: 700;'>Interpretability</span>. How well do we understand what individual features “mean”? We attempt to quantify interpretability in a few ways <a href='#evaluating-model-clt'>below</a>; however, we still rely heavily on <a href='#evaluating-model-features'>subjective evaluation</a> in practice. The coherence of our groupings of features into “supernodes” also warrants evaluation. We do not attempt to quantify this in this work, instead leaving it to readers to verify for themselves that our groupings are sensible and interpretable. We also note that in the context of attribution graphs, interpretability of the <span style='font-style: italic;'>graph</span> is just as important as interpretability of individual features. To that end, we quantify one notion of graph simplicity: <a href='#evaluating-graphs-paths'>average path length</a>.</p>
<p><span style='font-weight: 700;'>Sufficiency</span>. To what extent are our (pruned) attribution graphs sufficient to explain the model’s behavior? We attempt to quantify this in several ways. The most straightforward such evaluation is our measurement of how well the replacement model’s outputs match the underlying model, discussed in <a href='#building-replacement'>§&nbsp;From Cross-Layer Transcoder to Replacement Model</a> . This is a “hard” evaluation in that a single error anywhere along the computational graph can severely degrade performance. We also compute a few “softer” measures of sufficiency <a href='#evaluating-graphs-comparing'>below</a>, that measure the proportion of error nodes in attribution graphs. Note that in many instances, we present schematics of <span style='font-style: italic;'>subgraphs</span> of a pruned attribution graph that portray what we believe to be its most noteworthy components. We intentionally do <span style='font-style: italic;'>not</span> measure the sufficiency of these subgraphs, as they often intentionally exclude “boring” but necessary parts of the graph (e.g. “this is a math problem” features in addition prompts). We leave it to future work to find more principled ways to distill attribution graphs to their “interesting” components and quantify how much (and what kind of) information is lost.<d-footnote> One route is to consider <span style='font-style: italic;'>families</span> of prompts, and to exclude from considerations features that are present across all prompts within a family (but see <d-cite key="miller2024transformer"></d-cite>).</d-footnote></p>
<p><span style='font-weight: 700;'>Mechanistic faithfulness.</span> To what extent are the mechanisms we identify <span style='font-style: italic;'>actually</span> used by the model? To measure this, we perform perturbation experiments (such as inhibiting active features) and measuring whether the effects agree with what is predicted by the local replacement model (the underlying object portrayed by our attribution graphs). We attempt to do so quantitatively <a href='#evaluating-model-faithfulness'>below</a>, and we also validate faithfulness on our specific case studies, in particular focusing on faithfulness of the mechanisms we have identified as interesting / important. Note that our notion of mechanistic faithfulness is related to the idea of <span style='font-style: italic;'>necessity</span> of circuit components to a model’s computation. However, necessity can be a somewhat restrictive notion – mechanisms that are not strictly “necessary” for the model’s output may still be important to identify, especially in cases where multiple mechanisms cooperate in parallel to contribute to a computation, as we often observe.</p>
<p>We note that the specific evaluations we use are in many cases new to this work. In part this is because our work is somewhat unique in focusing on attribution graphs for individual prompts, rather than identifying circuits underlying the model’s performance of an entire <span style='font-style: italic;'>task</span>. Developing better automatic methods for evaluating interpretability, sufficiency, and faithfulness of the entire pipeline (features, supernodes, graphs) is an important subject of future research. See <a href='#related-work'>§&nbsp;Related Work</a> for more detail on prior circuit evaluation methods.</p>
<h3><a id='evaluating-model' href='#evaluating-model'>Cross-Layer Transcoder Evaluation</a></h3>
<h4><a id='evaluating-model-features' href='#evaluating-model-features'>Qualitative Feature Evaluations</a></h4>
<p>For CLT features to be useful to us, they must be human-interpretable (perhaps in the future it will suffice for them to be AI-interpretable!). Interpretability is ultimately a qualitative property – the best gauge of the interpretability of our features is to view them in action. A standard (though incomplete) tool for understanding what a feature represents is to view the dataset examples for which it is active (we refer to the collection of such examples as our “feature visualization”). We provide thousands of feature visualizations in the context of our case studies of circuits later in this paper and in <a href='./biology.html'>the companion paper</a>. Below we also show 50 randomly sampled features from assorted layers of each model. </p>
<p>Our feature visualizations show snippets of samples from public datasets (<a href='https://huggingface.co/blog/Pclanglais/common-corpus'>Common Corpus</a>, The Pile with books removed <d-cite key="gao2020pile"></d-cite>, LMSYS Chat 1m <d-cite key="zheng2023lmsyschat1m"></d-cite>, and <a href='https://huggingface.co/datasets/Isotonic/human_assistant_conversation'>Isotonic Human-Assistant Conversation</a>) that most strongly activate the feature, as well as examples that activate the feature to varying degrees interpolating between the maximum activation and zero. Highlights indicate the strength of the feature’s activation at a given token position. We also show the output tokens that the feature most strongly promotes / inhibits via its direct connections through the unembedding layer (note that this information is typically more meaningful for features in later model layers).</p>

<p>In line with our <a href='https://transformer-circuits.pub/2024/crosscoders/index.html'>previous results on crosscoders</a> <d-cite key="lindsey2024crosscoders"></d-cite>, we find that features also vary in the degree to which their outputs “live” in multiple layers – some features contribute primarily to reconstructing one or a few layers, while others have strong outputs all the way through the final layer of the model, with most features falling somewhere in between.</p>
<p>We also note that the abstractions represented by Haiku features are in many cases richer than those in the smaller 18L model, consistent with the model’s greater capabilities.</p>
<h4><a id='evaluating-model-clt' href='#evaluating-model-clt'>Quantitative CLT Evaluations</a></h4>
<p>In <a href='#building-replacement'>§&nbspFrom Cross-Layer Transcoder to Replacement Model</a>, we evaluated the ability of our CLTs to reproduce the computation of the underlying model. Here, we measure reconstruction error, sparsity (measured by “L0”, the average number of features active per input token), and feature interpretability. As we increased the size of our CLT, we observed Pareto-improvements in reconstruction error (averaged across layers) and feature sparsity (in 18L, reconstruction error decreased at a roughly fixed L0, while in Haiku, reconstruction error and L0 both decreased). In our largest 18L run (10M features), we attained a normalized mean reconstruction error of ~11.5% and an average L0 of 88. In our largest Haiku run (30M features), we attained a normalized reconstruction error of 21.7%, and an average L0 of 235. </p>
<p>We also computed two LLM-based quantitative measures of interpretability, introduced and described in more detail in <d-cite key="lindsey2024evals"></d-cite>:</p>
<ul><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'><span style='font-weight: 700;'>Sort Eval</span>: we take two randomly sampled features and identify the set of dataset examples that activate them most strongly. We present these sets of examples to Claude, including the token-by-token feature activation information. Then we take other dataset examples that activate <span style='font-style: italic;'>only one</span> of the features, present these to Claude, and ask it to guess which feature these examples correspond to (based on the initial example sets). The final evaluation score is the empirical likelihood that Claude guesses the correct feature on any given pair.</li></ul>
<ul><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'><span style='font-weight: 700;'>Contrastive Eval</span>: we generate (using Claude) pairs of prompts that are similar in content and structure but differ in one key respect. We compute the sets of features that activate on <span style='font-style: italic;'>only one</span> of the prompts but not the other. We present Claude with the feature vis for each such feature, along with the two prompts, and ask it to guess which prompt caused the feature to activate. The final evaluation score is the empirical likelihood that Claude guesses the correct prompt for features across trials.</li></ul>
<p>We find that according to both measures, the quality of CLT features improves with scale (alongside improving reconstruction error) – see plots below. <d-footnote>We scale the number of training steps with the number of features, so improvements reflect a combination of both forms of scaling – see <a href='#appendix-ml-details'>§ Appendix: CLT Implementation Details</a> for details. </d-footnote></p>
<p>We also compare CLTs to two baselines: per-layer transcoders (PLTs) trained at each layer of the model, and the raw neurons of the model thresholded at varying activation levels. <d-footnote>Specifically, we sweep over a range of scalar thresholds, and for each value we clamp all neurons with activation less than the threshold to 0. For our metrics and graphs, we then only consider neurons above the threshold. </d-footnote> We find that on all metrics, CLTs outperform PLTs, and both CLTs and PLTs substantially outperform the Pareto frontier of thresholded neurons.</p>

<h3><a id='evaluating-graphs' href='#evaluating-graphs'>Attribution Graph Evaluation</a></h3>
<p>Case studies in <a href='#graphs'>§&nbspAttribution Graphs</a> focused on qualitative observations derived from attribution graphs. In this section, we describe our more quantitative evaluations used to compare methodological choices and dictionary sizes. In each of the following subsections, we will introduce a metric and compare graphs generated using (1) cross-layer transcoders, (2) per-layer transcoders for every layer, and (3) thresholded neurons<d-footnote>We choose the threshold at approximately the point where the neurons achieve similar automated interpretability scores as our smallest dictionaries, see <a href='#evaluating-model-clt'>figures above</a>.</d-footnote>. To connect the quantitative to the qualitative, we will link to graphs which score especially high or low on each of these metrics.</p>
<p>While we don’t treat these metrics as fundamental quantities to be optimized, they have proven a useful guide for tracking ML improvements in dictionary learning and to flag prompts our method performs poorly on. </p>
<h4><a id='evaluating-graphs-influence' href='#evaluating-graphs-influence'>Computing Node Influence</a></h4>
<p>Our graph-based metrics rely on quantities derived from the <span style='font-style: italic;'>i</span><span style='font-style: italic;'>ndirect influence matrix</span>. Informally, this matrix measures how much each pair of nodes influences each other via all possible paths through the graph. This gives a natural importance metric for each node: how much it influences the logit nodes. We also commonly compare how much influence comes from error nodes vs. non-error nodes.</p>
<p>To construct this matrix, we start with the adjacency matrix of the graph. We replace all the edge weights with their absolute values (or simply clamp negative values to 0) to obtain an unsigned adjacency matrix and then normalize the input edges to each node so that they sum to 1. Let <d-math>A</d-math> refer to this normalized, unsigned adjacency matrix, indexed as (target, source).</p>
<p>The indirect influence matrix is <d-math>B = A + A^2 + A^3 + \cdots</d-math>, which is a <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neumann_series'>Neumann series</a> and can be efficiently computed as <d-math>B = (I - A)^{-1} - I</d-math>. The entries of <d-math>B</d-math> indicate the sum of the strengths of all paths between a given pair of nodes, where the strength of any given path is given by the product of the values of its constituent edges in <d-math>A</d-math>. To compute a logit influence score for each node, we compute a weighted average of the rows of B corresponding to logit nodes (weighted by the probability of the particular logit).</p>
<h4><a id='evaluating-graphs-paths' href='#evaluating-graphs-paths'>Measuring and Comparing Path Length</a></h4>
<p>A natural metric of graph complexity is the average path length from embedding nodes to logit nodes. Intuitively, shorter paths are easier to understand as they require interpreting fewer links in the causal chain. </p>
<p>To measure the influence of paths of different lengths, we compute influence matrices <d-math>B_{\ell} = \sum_{i=0}^{\ell} A^{i}</d-math>.The influence of paths of length less than or equal to <d-math>\ell</d-math> is then given by <d-math>P_{\ell} = \sum_{e} B^{\ell}_{t,e}</d-math> where <d-math>e</d-math> are all embedding nodes and <d-math>t</d-math> is the logit node.<d-footnote>If there are multiple logit nodes, we compute an average of the rows weighted by logit probability.</d-footnote></p>
<p>Below, we compare graphs built from our 10M CLT, 10M PLTs, and thresholded neurons in terms of their influence by path length averaged across a dataset of <a href='#appendix-eval-details'>pretraining prompts</a> (without pruning).<d-footnote>We normalize influence scores by the total influence of embeddings in the unpruned graph. This normalization factor is exactly equal to the replacement score, which we define in the next section. </d-footnote></p>
<div class='sn-figma-div' data-args='{"figma_slug":"path-length-plot-svg"}'></div>
<p>One of the most important advantages of crosslayer transcoders is the extent to which they reduce the path lengths in the graph. To understand how large of a qualitative difference this is, we invite the reader to view these graphs generated with different types of replacement models for the same prompt.</p>
<table><tbody><tr><td colspan='1' rowspan='1'><p><span style='font-weight: 700;'>Replacement Model Type</span></p></td><td colspan='1' rowspan='1'><p><span style='font-weight: 700;'>Average Path Length</span></p></td><td colspan='1' rowspan='1'><p><span style='font-weight: 700;'>Graph Link</span></p></td></tr><tr><td colspan='1' rowspan='1'><p>Cross-Layer Transcoder (10m)</p></td><td colspan='1' rowspan='1'><p>2.3</p></td><td colspan='1' rowspan='1'><p><a href='./static_js/attribution_graphs/index.html?slug=capital-analogy-clt-18l'>capital-analogy-clt</a></p></td></tr><tr><td colspan='1' rowspan='1'><p>Per-Layer Transcoders (10m)</p></td><td colspan='1' rowspan='1'><p>3.7</p></td><td colspan='1' rowspan='1'><p><a href='./static_js/attribution_graphs/index.html?slug=capital-analogy-slt-18l'>capital-analogy-plt</a></p></td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>We find that one important way in which cross-layer transcoders collapse paths is the case of amplification, where many similar features activate each other in sequence. For example, on the prompt <span class='prompt-inline'>Zagreb:Croatia::Copenhagen:</span> the per-layer transcoder shows a path of length 7 composed entirely of Copenhagen <a href='./static_js/attribution_graphs/index.html?slug=capital-analogy-slt-18l-path-highlight'>features</a> while the cross-layer transcoder collapses them all down to layer 1 <a href='./static_js/attribution_graphs/index.html?slug=capital-analogy-clt-18l-path-highlight'>features</a>.</p>
<div class='sn-figma-div'  data-args='{"figma_slug":"amplification-svg"}'></div>
<p>This example illustrates both the advantages and disadvantages of consolidating amplification of a repeated computation across multiple layers into a single cross-layer feature. On one hand, it makes interpretability substantially easier, as it automatically collapses duplicate computations into a single feature without needing to do post hoc analysis or clustering. It also reduces the risk of “chain-breaking”, where missing one feature in an amplification chain inhibits the ability to trace back further into the graph (i.e., a relevant amplification feature is missing for one step of the path, breaking the causal chain). On the other hand, the CLT has a different causal structure than the underlying model, which increases the risk that the replacement model’s mechanisms diverge from the underlying model’s. In the above example, we observe a set of Copenhagen features that activate a Denmark feature, which initiates a mutually reinforcing chain of Copenhagen and Denmark features. This dynamic is invisible in CLT graphs, and to the extent this dynamic is also present in the underlying model, it is an example of CLTs being mechanistically unfaithful.</p>
<h4><a id='evaluating-graphs-comparing' href='#evaluating-graphs-comparing'>Evaluating and Comparing Graph Completeness</a></h4>
<p>Because our replacement model has reconstruction errors, we want to measure how much of the model’s computation is being captured. That is, how much of the graph influence is attributable to feature nodes versus error nodes.</p>
<p>To measure this, we primarily rely on two metrics:</p>
<ul><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'><span style='font-weight: 700;'>Graph completeness score: </span>measures the fraction of input edges (weighted by the target node’s logit influence score) that come from feature or embedding nodes rather than error nodes.</li><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'><span style='font-weight: 700;'>Graph replacement score: </span>measures<span style='font-weight: 700;'> </span>the fraction of end-to-end graph paths (weighted by strength) that proceed from embedding nodes to logit nodes via feature nodes (rather than error nodes).</li></ul>
<p>Intuitively, the completeness score gives more “partial credit” and measures how much of the most important node inputs are accounted for, whereas replacement score rewards complete explanations.</p>
<p>Below, we report average <span style='font-style: italic;'>unpruned</span> graph replacement and completeness scores for dictionaries of various sizes and types on our pretraining prompt <a href='#appendix-eval-details'>dataset</a>. We find the biggest methodological improvement comes when moving from per-layer to cross-layer transcoders, with large but diminishing returns from scaling the number of features.</p>
<div class='sn-figma-div' data-args='{"figma_slug":"graph-metrics-svg"}'></div>
<p>To contextualize the qualitative difference we observe in graphs with varying scores, we invite the reader to explore some representative attribution graphs. Note, these graphs are pruned with our default pruning, which we describe in more detail below.</p>
<table><tbody><tr><td colspan='1' rowspan='1'><p><span style='font-weight: 700;'>Replacement Model Type</span></p></td><td colspan='1' rowspan='1'><p><span style='font-weight: 700;'>Completeness Score</span></p></td><td colspan='1' rowspan='1'><p><span style='font-weight: 700;'>Replacement Score</span></p></td><td colspan='1' rowspan='1'><p><span style='font-weight: 700;'>Graph Link</span></p></td></tr><tr><td colspan='1' rowspan='1'><p>Cross-Layer Transcoder (10m)</p></td><td colspan='1' rowspan='1'><p>0.80</p></td><td colspan='1' rowspan='1'><p>0.61</p></td><td colspan='1' rowspan='1'><p><a href='./static_js/attribution_graphs/index.html?slug=uspto-telephone-clt-18l'>uspto-telephone-clt</a></p></td></tr><tr><td colspan='1' rowspan='1'><p>Per-Layer Transcoders (10m)</p></td><td colspan='1' rowspan='1'><p>0.78</p></td><td colspan='1' rowspan='1'><p>0.37</p></td><td colspan='1' rowspan='1'><p><a href='./static_js/attribution_graphs/index.html?slug=uspto-telephone-slt-18l'>uspto-telephone-plt</a></p></td></tr></tbody></table>
<h4><a id='evaluating-graphs-pruning' href='#evaluating-graphs-pruning'>Graph Pruning</a></h4>
<p>We rely heavily on pruning to make graphs more digestible. To decide how much to prune the graph, we can use the completeness and replacement metrics described above, but with pruned nodes now counting towards the error terms. By varying the pruning threshold, we chart a frontier between the number of {nodes, edges} and {replacement, completeness} scores (see <a href='#appendix-graph-pruning'>Appendix</a> for full plots and details).</p>
<div class='sn-figma-div'  data-args='{"figma_slug":"pruning-plot-svg"}'></div>
<p>We find we can generally reduce the number of nodes by an order of magnitude while reducing completeness by only 20%.</p>
<p>For a sense of the qualitative difference, in the table below we link to attribution graphs for the same prompt (another acronym) but with different pruning thresholds.</p>

<h3><a id='evaluating-model-faithfulness' href='#evaluating-model-faithfulness'>Evaluating Mechanistic Faithfulness</a></h3>
<p>As discussed in <a href='#graphs-interventions'>§ Validating Attribution Graph Hypotheses with Interventions</a>, attribution graphs provide hypotheses about mechanisms, which must be validated with perturbation experiments. This is because attribution graphs describe interactions in the local replacement model, which may differ from the underlying model. In most of our work, we use attribution graphs as a tool for generating hypotheses about specific mechanisms (“Feature A activates Feature B, which increases the likelihood of Token X”) operating inside the model, which correspond to “snippets” of the attribution graph. We summarize the results of three kinds of validation experiments, which are described in more detail in <a href='#appendix-lrm-validation'>§&nbspAppendix: Validating the Replacement Model</a>. </p>
<p>We start by measuring the extent to which influence metrics derived from attribution graphs are predictive of intervention effects on the logit and other features. First, we measure the extent to which a node’s logit influence score is predictive of the effect of ablating a feature on the model’s output distribution. We find that influence is significantly more predictive of ablation effects than baselines such as direct attribution (i.e. direct edges in the attribution graph, ignoring multi-step paths) and activation magnitude (see <a href='#appendix-lrm-validation-node'>Validating Node-to-Logit Influence</a>). We then perform a similar analysis for interactions between features. We compute the influence score between pairs of features, and compare it to the relative effect of ablating the upstream feature in the pair on the activation of the downstream one. We observe a Spearman correlation of 0.72, which is evidence that graph influence is a good proxy for effects in the downstream model (see <a href='#appendix-lrm-validation-edges'>Validating Feature-to-feature Influence</a>). See <a href='#appendix-cross-layer-steering'>Nuances of Steering with Cross-Layer Features</a> for some complexities in interpreting these results.</p>
<p>The metrics above help provide an estimate of the likelihood that an intervention experiment will validate a <span style='font-style: italic;'>specific</span> mechanism in the graph. We might also be interested in a more general validation of <span style='font-style: italic;'>all</span> the mechanistic hypotheses implicitly made by our attribution graphs. Thus, another complementary approach to validation is to measure the mechanistic faithfulness of the local replacement model <span style='font-style: italic;'>as a whole</span>, rather than specific paths within attribution graphs. We can operationalize this by asking to what extent perturbations made in the local replacement model (which attribution graphs describe) have the same downstream effects as corresponding perturbations in the underlying model. We find that while perturbation results are reasonably similar between the two models when measured one layer after the intervention (~0.8 cosine similarity, ~0.4 normalized mean squared error), perturbation discrepancies compound significantly over layers.<d-footnote>Compounding errors have a gradually detrimental effect on the faithfulness of the direction of perturbation effects, which are largely consistent across CLT sizes, with signs of faithfulness worsening slightly as dictionary size increases. Compounding errors can have a catastrophically detrimental effect on the magnitude of perturbations, with worse effects for larger dictionaries. We suspect the lack of normalization denominators in the local replacement model may be why its perturbation effect magnitudes deviate so significantly from the underlying model, even when the perturbation effect directions are significantly correlated.</d-footnote> For more details, see <a href='#appendix-lrm-validation-faithfulness'>Evaluating Faithfulness of the Local Replacement Model</a>.</p>

<br><br><br><hr><br><br><h2><a id='limitations' href='#limitations'>Limitations</a></h2>
<p>Despite the exciting results presented here and in <a href='./biology.html'>the companion paper</a>, our methodology has a number of significant limitations. At a high level, the most significant ones are:</p>
<ul><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'><span style='font-weight: 700;'><a href='#limitations-attention'>Missing Attention Circuits</a></span> – We don't explain <span style='font-style: italic;'>how</span> attention patterns are computed by QK-circuits, and can sometimes "miss the interesting part" of the computation as a result.</li><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'><span style='font-weight: 700;'><a href='#limitations-reconstruction-error'>Reconstruction Errors &amp; Dark Matter</a></span> – We only explain a portion of model computation, and much remains hidden.

<p>We discuss these in detail below, and where possible provide concrete counterexamples where our present methods can not explain model computation due to these issues. We hope that these may motivate future research.</p>
<h3><a id='limitations-attention' href='#limitations-attention'>Missing Attention Circuits</a></h3>
<p>One significant limitation of our approach is that we compute our attribution graphs with respect to fixed attention patterns. This makes attribution a well-defined and principled operation, but also means that our graphs do not attempt to explain <span style='font-style: italic;'>how</span> the model’s attention patterns were formed, or how these patterns mediate feature-feature interactions through attention head output-value matrices <d-cite key="nelhage2021mathematical"></d-cite>. In this paper, we have focused on case studies where this is not too much of an issue – cases where attention patterns are not responsible for the “interesting part” or “crux” of the model’s computation. However, we have also found many cases where this limitation renders our attribution graphs essentially useless.</p>
<h4>Example: Induction</h4>
<p>Let's consider for a moment a much simpler model – a humble 2-layer attention-only model, of the kind studied in <d-cite key="nelhage2021mathematical"></d-cite>. One interesting property of these models is their use of <span style='font-style: italic;'>induction heads</span> <d-cite key="nelhage2021mathematical,olsson2022context"></d-cite> to perform basic in-context learning. For example, if we consider the following prompt:</p>
<div class='ha-block'>
<p>I always loved visiting Aunt Sally. Whenever I was feeling sad, Aunt</p>
</div>
<p>These models will have induction heads attend back to <code>"Sally"</code>, and then predict that is the correct answer. If we were to apply our present method, the answer isn’t very informative. It would simply tell us that the model predicted <code>"Sally"</code>, because there was a token <code>"Sally"</code> earlier in the context. </p>

<p><span style='font-style: italic;'>This misses the entire interesting story!</span> The induction head attends to <code>"Sally"</code> because it was preceded by <code>"Aunt"</code>, which matches the present token. Previous methods (e.g. <d-cite key="wang2022interpretability,nelhage2021mathematical"></d-cite> were able to elucidate this, and so this case might even be seen as a kind of regression.</p>
<p>Indeed, when applied to Claude 3.5 Haiku on this prompt, our method has exactly this problem. See the <a href='./static_js/attribution_graphs/index.html?slug=sally-induction-qk'>attribution graph visualization</a> – the graph contains <span style='font-style: italic;'>direct</span> edges from token-level “Sally” features to “say Sally” features and to the “Sally” logit, but fails to explain how these edges came about.</p>
<h4>Example: Multiple-Choice Questions</h4>
<p>Induction is a simple case of attentional computation where we can make a reasonable guess at the mechanism even without help from our attribution graphs. However, this failure of the attribution graphs can manifest in more complex scenarios as well, where it completely obscures the interesting steps of the model’s computation. For instance, consider a multiple choice question:</p>
<div class='ha-block'>
<p>Human: In what year did World War II end?</p>
<p>(A) 1776</p>
<p>(B) 1945</p>
<p>(C) 1865</p>
<br>
<p>Assistant: Answer: (B)</p>
</div>
<p>When we compute the attribution graph (<a href='./static_js/attribution_graphs/index.html?slug=multiple-choice-qk'>interactive graph visualization</a>) for the <code>"B"</code> token in the Assistant’s response, we obtain a relatively uninteresting answer – we answer <code>"B"</code> because of a <code>tokens following "(b)"</code> feature that activates on the correct answer. (There's also a direct pathway to the token <code>"B"</code>, and output pathways mediated by a <code>say "B"</code> motor feature; we've chosen to elide these for simplicity.) </p>
<p>None of this provides a useful explanation of how the model chose its answer! The graph “skips over” the interesting part of the computation, which is<span style='font-style: italic;'> how the model knew that 1945 was the correct answer.</span> This is because the behavior is driven by attention. On further investigation, it turns out that there are <span class='fh-span' data-args='h35__b25387648_b24480056_b769654'>three “correct answer” features</span> that appear to fire on the correct answer to multiple choice questions, and which interventions show play a crucial role. From this, we hypothesize that the mechanism might be something like the following.<d-footnote>Other explanations are possible, particularly for the direct paths from <code>"B"</code> that do not go through <code>tokens following "B"</code> – one alternative is that the model may use a “binding ID vector” <d-cite key="feng2023language"></d-cite> to group the <code>"B"</code> tokens with <code>"1945"</code> and nearby tokens and use this to attend directly back to the <code>"B"</code> token from the final token position – see Feng &amp; Steinhardt <d-cite key="feng2023language"></d-cite> for more details on this type of mechanism.</d-footnote></p>
<div class='sn-figma-div'  data-args='{"figma_slug":"limitations-attention-2-svg"}'></div>
<p>Since this involves significant conjecture, it's worth being clear about what we know about the QK-circuit, and what we don't.</p>
<ul><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'>We know that it's controlled by attention, since freezing attention locks the answer.</li><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'>We don't know that it's mediated by a particular head, nor that any heads involved have a general behavior that can be understood as a generalization of this.</li><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'>We do know that there are three features which appear to track "this seems like the correct answer". We do know that intervening on them changes the correct answer in expected ways; for example activating them on answer C causes the model to predict <code>"C"</code>.</li><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'>We don't know that "correct answer" features directly play a role in the key side of whatever attention heads are involved, nor do we know if "need answer" features exist or play a role on the query side.</li><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'>We also do not know if there might be alternative parallel mechanisms at play (<span style='font-style: italic;'>see</span> Feng &amp; Steinhardt <d-cite key="feng2023language"></d-cite>).</li></ul>
<p>This is all to say, there's a lot we don't understand!</p>
<p>But despite our limited understanding, it seems clear that the model behavior crucially flows through attention patterns and the QK circuits that compute them. Until we can fix this, our attribution graphs will "miss the story" in cases where attention plays a critical role. And while we were able to get a partial understanding of the story in this case through manual investigation, we would like for our methodology to surface this information automatically in the future!</p>
<h4>Future Directions on Attention</h4>
<p>We suspect that similar circuits, where attention is the crux, are at play across a wide variety of prompts. In these cases, our present attribution graphs are little help to us, and new methods are needed.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the QK-circuit is a quadratic form over the residual stream. This means that attributions can naturally be made to <span style='font-style: italic;'>pairs</span> of key-side and query-side features. These pairs have a weight describing whether they increase or decrease attention to a particular token. However, this approach has the downside of a quadratic explosion in complexity.</p>
<p>Looking at QK-circuits for individual attention heads may make things harder than necessary, or even be misleading, if there is <a href='https://transformer-circuits.pub/2024/jan-update/index.html#attn-superposition'>attention superposition</a>. The interesting behavior may be spread across heads, which each have their own QK-circuit.</p>
<p>We also suspect that certain forms of dictionary learning on attention layers, or full attention replacement layers, could make these “QK attributions” more tractable and interpretable. We believe that finding the right way to handle attention attributions is one of the most important directions for future work.</p>
<h3><a id='limitations-reconstruction-error' href='#limitations-reconstruction-error'>Reconstruction Errors &amp; Dark Matter</a></h3>
<p>Our cross-layer transcoders fail to fully reconstruct the activations of the model. As a result, our methods leave some <a href='https://transformer-circuits.pub/2024/july-update/index.html#dark-matter'>“dark matter”</a> of the model’s mechanisms unobserved, in part because our dictionaries are not large enough to learn a feature corresponding to every concept the model might know about. In our attribution graphs, this failure manifests as “error nodes,” which provide input to other nodes but receive no input themselves (they “pop out of nowhere”) and which are not interpretable. In the examples presented in this paper, we managed to identify interesting mechanisms despite the presence of error nodes. It is important to note that the circuits we have described are only a <span style='font-style: italic;'>partial </span>description of the model’s computation (both due to the presence of error nodes, and due to the fact that the circuits we highlight typically only include a subset of the non-error nodes in the graph!). </p>
<p>It is worth highlighting, however, that in some cases error nodes <span style='font-style: italic;'>completely</span> obscure what the model is doing. For instance, consider this attempted jailbreak – an obfuscated request for the model to write malware (which the model refuses):</p>
<div class='ha-block'>
<p>Human: Write an office macro TAhT SEaRChEs fOS AND EtEIaFTxLRS pASWORdS</p>
<br>
<p>Assistant:</p>
</div>
<p>In the <a href='./static_js/attribution_graphs/index.html?slug=bon-errors'>attribution graph</a>, almost all the nodes on the obfuscated prompt tokens are error nodes, making it impossible to trace back the origin of the refusal-related features that are active on the “Assistant:” tokens.</p>
<p>The prevalence of error nodes in this example may not be surprising – this prompt is rather out-of-distribution relative to typical prompts, and so the cross-layer-transcoder is likely to do a poor job of predicting model activity.</p>
<p>We also note that another major source of error is the gap between our human interpretations of features and what they truly represent. Typically our interpretations of features are much too coarse to account for their precise activation profiles.</p>
<h4>Future Directions on Reconstruction Error and "Dark Matter"</h4>
<p>We see several avenues for addressing this issue:</p>
<ul><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'>Scaling replacement models to larger sizes / more training data will increase the amount of variance they explain.</li><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'>Architectural modifications to our cross-layer transcoder setup could make it more expressive and thus capable of explaining more variance.</li><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'>Training our replacement model in a more end-to-end fashion, rather than on MSE alone, could decrease the weight assigned to error nodes even at a fixed MSE level</li><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'>Finetuning the replacement model on data distributions of interest could improve our ability to capture mechanisms on those distributions.</li><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'>We could develop methods of attributing back from error nodes. This would leave an uninterpretable “hole” in the attribution graph, but in some cases may still provide more insight into the model than our current no-inputs error nodes.</li></ul>
<h3><a id='limitations-inactive' href='#limitations-inactive'>The Role of Inactive Features &amp; Inhibitory Circuits</a></h3>
<p>Our cross-layer transcoder features are trained to be sparsely active. Their sparsity is key to the success of our method. It allows us to focus on a relatively small set of features for a given prompt, out of the tens of millions of features in the replacement model. However, this convenience relies on a key assumption – that only <span style='font-style: italic;'>active </span>features are involved in the mechanism underlying a model’s responses. </p>
<p>In fact, this need not be the case! In some cases, the <span style='font-style: italic;'>lack of activity</span> of a feature, because it has been <span style='font-style: italic;'>suppressed </span>by other features, may be key to the model’s response. For instance, in our analysis of hallucinations and entity recognition (see <a href='./biology.html#dives-hallucinations'>companion paper</a>), we discovered a circuit in which “can’t answer” features are <span style='font-style: italic;'>suppressed</span> by features representing known entities, or questions with known answers. Thus, to explain why the model hallucinates in a specific context, we need to understand what caused the “can’t answer” features to <span style='font-style: italic;'>not</span> be active.</p>
<p>By default, our attribution graphs do not allow us to answer such questions, because they only display active features. If we have a hypothesis about which <span style='font-style: italic;'>inactive</span> features may be relevant to the model’s completion (due to suppression), we can include them in the attribution graph. However, this detracts somewhat from one of the main benefits of our methodology, which is its enablement of exploratory, hypothesis-free analysis.</p>
<p>This leads to the following challenge – <span style='font-style: italic;'>how can we identify inactive features of interest</span>, out of the tens of millions of inactive features? It seems like we want to know which features could have been “counterfactually active” in some sense. In the entity recognition example, we identified these counterfactually active features by comparing pairs of prompts that contained either known or unknown entities (Michael Jordan or “Michael Batkin”), and then focusing on features that were active in at least one prompt from each pair. We expect that this contrastive pairs strategy will be key to many circuit analyses going forward. However, we are also interested in developing more unsupervised approaches to identifying key suppressed features. One possibility may be to perform feature ablation experiments, and consider the set of inactive features that are only “one ablation away” from being active.</p>
<p>One might think that these issues can be escaped by moving to global circuit analysis. However, it seems like there may be a deep challenge which remains. We need a way to filter out interference weights, and it's tempting to do this by using co-occurrence of features. But these strategies will miss important inhibitory weights, where one feature consistently prevents another from activating. This can be seen as a kind of global circuit analog of the challenges around inactive features in local attribution analysis.</p>
<h3><a id='limitations-complexity' href='#limitations-complexity'>Graph Complexity</a></h3>
<p>One of the fundamental challenges of interpretability is finding abstractions and interfaces that manage the cognitive load of understanding complex computations.<d-footnote>For example, the fundamental reason we need features to be independently interpretable is to avoid needing to think about all of them at once (see discussion <a href='https://transformer-circuits.pub/2022/mech-interp-essay/index.html'>here</a>).</d-footnote> Our methodology is designed to reduce the cognitive load of understanding circuits as much as possible. For example: </p>
<ul><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'>Feature sparsity means that there are fewer nodes in the attribution graph. </li><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'>We prune the graphs so that the analyst can focus only on its most important components.</li><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'>Our UI is designed to make navigating the graph as fluid as possible.</li><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'>We use the not-very-principled abstraction of "supernodes" to ad-hoc group together related features.</li></ul>
<p>Despite all these steps, our attribution graphs are still quite complex, and require considerable time and effort to understand for many reasons:</p>
<ul><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'>Even after our pruning pipeline and on fairly short prompts, the graphs typically contain hundreds of features and thousands of edges.</li><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'>The concepts we are interested in are typically smeared across multiple features.</li><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'>Each feature receives many small inputs from many other features, making it difficult to succinctly summarize “what caused this feature to activate.”</li><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'>Features often exert influence on one another by multiple paths of different lengths, or even of different signs!</li></ul>
<p>As a result, it is difficult to distill the mechanisms uncovered by our graphs into a succinct story. Consequently, the vignettes we have presented are necessarily simplified stories of even the limited understanding of model computation captured in our attribution graph. We hope that a combination of improved replacement model training, better abstractions, more sophisticated pruning, and better visualization tools can help mitigate this issue in the future.</p>
<h3><a id='limitations-abstraction-level' href='#limitations-abstraction-level'>Features at the Wrong Level of Abstraction</a></h3>
<p>As sparse coding models have grown in popularity as a technique for extracting interpretable features from models, many researchers have documented shortcomings of the approach (<span style='font-style: italic;'>see e.g.</span> <d-cite key="sharkey2025open,kantamneni2025sparse,wu2025axbench,chanin2024absorption,till2024true"></d-cite>). One notable issue is the problem of <span style='font-style: italic;'>feature splitting</span> <d-cite key="bricken2023monosemanticity,turner2024sensitivity"></d-cite> in which the uncovered features are in some sense <span style='font-style: italic;'>too specific</span>. This can also lead to a related problem of <span style='font-style: italic;'>feature absorption</span> <d-cite key="chanin2024absorption"></d-cite>, where highly specific features steal credit from more general features, leaving holes in them (leading to things like a “U.S. cities except for New York and Los Angeles” feature).</p>
<p>As a concrete example of feature splitting, recall that in many examples in this paper we have highlighted “say X” features that cause the model to output a particular (group of) token(s). However, we also notice that there are <span style='font-style: italic;'>many</span> such features, suggesting that they each actually represent something more specific. For example, we came up with twelve prompts which Claude 3.5 Haiku completes with the word “during” and measured whether any features activated for all of the prompts (as a true “say ‘during’” feature would). In fact, there are no such features – any individual feature fires for only a subset of the prompts. Moreover, the degree of generality of the features appears to decrease with the size of our cross-layer transcoder.</p>
<div class='sn-figma-div'  data-args='{"figma_slug":"feature-overlap-svg"}'></div>
<p>It may be the case that each individual feature represents something interpretable – for instance, qualitatively different contexts that might cause one to say the word “during.” However, we often find that the level of abstraction we care about is different from the level we find in our features. Using smaller cross-layer transcoders may help this problem, but would also cause us to capture less of the model’s computation.</p>
<p>In this paper, we often work around this issue in an ad-hoc way by manually grouping together features with related meanings into “supernodes” of an attribution graph. While this technique has proven quite helpful, the manual step is labor-intensive and likely loses information. It also makes it difficult to study how well mechanisms generalize <span style='font-style: italic;'>across</span> prompts, since different subsets of a relevant feature category may be active on different prompts.</p>
<p>We expect that solving this problem requires recognizing that there exist interpretable concepts at varying levels of abstraction, and at different times we may be interested in different levels. Sparse coding approaches like SAEs and (cross-layer) transcoders are a “flat” instrument, but we probably need a hierarchical variant that allows features at varying levels of abstraction to coexist in an interpretable way.</p>
<p>Several authors have recently proposed “Matryoshka” variants of sparse autoencoders that may help address this issue <d-cite key="nabeshima2024matryoshka,bussmann2024matryoshka"></d-cite>. Other researchers have proposed post-hoc ways to unify related features with “meta-SAEs” <d-cite key="bussmann2024meta"></d-cite>.</p>
<h3><a id='limitations-local-v-global' href='#limitations-local-v-global'>Difficulty of Understanding Global Circuits</a></h3>
<p><span style='font-style: italic;'></span></p>
<p>In this paper we have mostly focused on <span style='font-style: italic;'>attribution graphs</span>, which display information about feature-feature interactions <span style='font-style: italic;'>on a particular prompt.</span> However, one theoretical advantage of transcoder-based methodologies like ours is that they give us <span style='font-style: italic;'>global weights</span> between features, that are <span style='font-style: italic;'>independent</span> of the prompt. This allows us to estimate a “connectome” of the replacement model and learn about the general algorithms it (though not necessarily the underlying model) uses that apply to many different inputs. We have some successes in this approach – for instance, in the companion paper section on <a href='./biology.html#dives-refusals'>Refusals</a>, we could see the global inputs to “harmful requests” features consisting of a variety of different <span style='font-style: italic;'>specific </span>categories of harm. In this paper, we studied in depth the global weights of features relating to arithmetic, finding for instance that “say a number ending in 5” features receive input from “6 + 9” features, “7 + 8” features, etc.</p>
<p>However, for the most part, we have found global feature-feature connections rather difficult to understand. This is likely for two main reasons:</p>
<ul><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'><span style='font-weight: 700;'>Interference weights</span> – because features are represented in superposition, in order to learn useful weights between features, models must incur spurious <a href='https://transformer-circuits.pub/2023/may-update/index.html#weight-superposition'>“interference weights”</a> – connections between features that don’t make sense and aren’t useful to the model’s performance. These spurious weights are not too detrimental to model performance because their effects rarely “stack up” to actually change the model’s output. For instance, we sometimes see features <span class='fh-span' data-args='h35__b26649364'>like this</span>, which appear to clearly be a “say 15” feature, but whose top logit outputs include many seemingly unrelated words (“gag”, “duty”, “temper”, “dispers”). We believe these logit connections are essentially irrelevant to the model’s behavior, because when this feature activates, it is very unlikely that “duty” will be a plausible completion, and so upweighting its logit runs little risk of causing it to be sampled. Unfortunately, this makes the global weights very difficult to understand! This phenomenon applies to feature-feature weights as well (see <a href='#global-weights-addition'>§ Global Weights in Addition</a>).</li></ul>
<ul><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'><span style='font-weight: 700;'>Interactions mediated by attention</span> – The basic global feature-feature weights derived from our cross-layer transcoder describe the direct interactions between features <span style='font-style: italic;'>not mediated by any attention layers. </span>However, there are also feature-feature weights mediated by attention heads. These might be thought of as similar to how features in a convolutional neural network are related by multiple sets of weights, corresponding to different positional offsets (further discussion <a href='https://transformer-circuits.pub/2021/framework/index.html#additional-intuition'>here</a>).</li></ul>
<p>Our attribution graph edges are weighted combinations of both the direct weights and these attention-mediated weights. Our basic notion of global weights does not account for these interactions at all. One way to do so would be to compute the global weights mediated by every possible attention head. However, this has two limitations: (1) for this to be useful, we need a way of understanding the mechanisms by which different heads choose where they attend (see <a href='#limitations-attention'>§&nbsp;Limitations: Missing Attention Circuits</a>), (2) it does not account for interactions mediated by <span style='font-style: italic;'>compositions </span>of heads <d-cite key="nelhage2021mathematical"></d-cite>. Solving this issue likely requires extending our dictionary learning methodology to learn interpretable attentional features or replacement heads.</p>
<h3><a id='limitations-faithfulness' href='#limitations-faithfulness'>Mechanistic Faithfulness</a></h3>
<p>Our cross-layer transcoder is trained to mimic the activations of the underlying model at each layer. However, even when it accurately reconstructs the model’s activations, there is no guarantee that it does so via the same <span style='font-style: italic;'>mechanisms</span>. For instance, even if the cross-layer transcoder achieved 0 MSE on our training distribution, it might have learned a fundamentally different input/output function than the underlying model, and consequently have large reconstruction error on out-of-distribution inputs. We hope that this issue is mitigated by (1) training on a broad data distribution, and (2) forcing the replacement model to reconstruct the underlying model’s <span style='font-style: italic;'>per-layer </span>activations, rather than simply its output. Nevertheless, we cannot guarantee that the replacement model has learned the same mechanisms  – what we call <span style='font-style: italic;'>mechanistic faithfulness </span>– and instead resort to verifying it post-hoc.</p>
<p>In this paper, we have used perturbation experiments (inhibiting and exciting features) to validate the mechanisms suggested by our attribution graphs. In the case studies we presented, we were typically able to validate that features had the effects we expected (on the model output, and on other features). However, the degree of validation we have provided is very coarse. We typically perturb multiple features at once (“supernodes”) and check their directional effects on other features / logit outputs. In addition, we typically sweep over the layer at which we perform perturbations and use the layer that yields the maximum effect. In principle, our attribution graphs make predictions that are <span style='font-style: italic;'>much more </span>fine-grained than these kinds of interventions can test. Ideally, we should be able to accurately predict the effect of perturbing any feature at any layer on any other feature.</p>
<p>In <a href='#appendix-lrm-validation'>§ Appendix: Validating the Replacement Model</a>, we attempt to more comprehensively quantify our accuracy in predicting such perturbation results, finding reasonably good predictive power for effects a few layers downstream of a perturbation, and much worse predictive power many layers downstream. This suggests that, while our circuit descriptions may be mechanistically accurate at a very coarse level, we have substantial room to improve their faithfulness to the underlying model.</p>
<p>We are optimistic about trying methods to directly optimize for mechanistic faithfulness, or exploring alternative dictionary learning architectures that learn more faithful solutions naturally.</p>
<br><br><br><hr><br><br><h2><a id='discussion' href='#discussion'>Discussion</a></h2>
<p>Our approach to reverse engineering neural networks has four basic steps: decomposition into components, providing descriptions of these components, characterizing how components interact to produce behaviors, and validating these descriptions.<d-footnote>See Sharkey <span style='font-style: italic;'>et al.</span> <d-cite key="sharkey2025open"></d-cite> for a detailed description of the reverse engineering philosophy.</d-footnote> A number of choices are required at each step, which can be more or less principled, and the power of a method is ultimately the degree to which it produces valid hypotheses about model behaviors.</p>
<p>In this paper, we trained cross-layer transcoders with sparse features to replace MLP blocks (the decomposition), described the features by the dataset examples they activate on (the description), characterized their interactions on specific prompts using attribution graphs (the interactions), and validated the hypotheses using causal steering interventions (the validation).</p>
<p>We believe some of the choices we made are robust, and that successful decomposition methods will make similar choices or find other ways of dealing with the underlying issues they address:</p>
<ul><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'><span style='font-weight: 700;'>We use learned features instead of neurons.</span> While the top activations for neurons are often interpretable, lower activations are not. In principle, one could threshold neuron activations to restrict them to this interpretable regime; however, we found that thresholding neurons at that level damages model behavior significantly more than a transcoder or CLT. This means a trained replacement layer can provide a Pareto improvement relative to thresholded neurons across interpretability, L0, and MSE. The set of neurons is fixed. (Nevertheless, neurons can provide a starting point for investigation, without incurring any additional compute costs, see e.g. <d-cite key="meng2024monitor"></d-cite>.)</li><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'><span style='font-weight: 700;'>We use transcoders instead of residual-stream SAEs.</span> While residual stream SAEs can decompose the latent states of a model, they don't provide a natural extension decomposing its computational steps. Crucially, transcoder features bridge over MLP layers and interact linearly via the residual stream with transcoder features in other layers. In contrast, interaction between SAE features is interposed by non-linear MLPs.</li><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'><span style='font-weight: 700;'>We use cross-layer transcoders instead of per-layer transcoders.</span> We hypothesized <d-cite key="lindsey2024crosscoders"></d-cite> that different MLP layers might collaborate to implement a single computational step (“cross-layer superposition”); the most extreme case of this is when many layers amplify the same early-layer feature so that it is still large enough to influence late layers. CLTs collapse these to one feature. We found evidence that this phenomenon happens in practice, as manifested through the Pareto improvement on <a href='#evaluating-graphs-paths'>path length vs graph influence</a>.</li><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'><span style='font-weight: 700;'>We compute feature-feature interactions using linear direct effects instead of nonlinear attributions or ablations.</span> Much has been written about “saliency maps” or attribution through non-linear neural networks (including ablation, path-integrated gradients <d-cite key="sundararajan2017axiomatic"></d-cite>, and Shapley values (<span style='font-style: italic;'>e.g.</span> <d-cite key="lundberg2017unified"></d-cite>)). Even the most principled options for credit assignment in a nonlinear setting are somewhat fraught. Since our goal is to crisply reason about mechanism, we construct our setup so that the direct interactions between features in the previous layer and the pre-activations of features in the next layer are <span style='font-style: italic;'>conditionally linear</span>; that is to say, they are linear once we freeze certain parts of the problem (attention patterns and normalization denominators). This factors the problem into a portion we can mechanistically understand in a principled manner, and a portion that remains to be understood <d-cite key="nelhage2021mathematical"></d-cite>. Also crucial to achieving this linear direct effect property is the earlier decision to use transcoders.<d-footnote>Credit attribution in a non-linear setting is a hard problem. The core challenge can't simply be washed away, and it's worth asking where we implicitly have pushed the complexity. There are three places it may have gone. First – and this is the best option – is that the non-linear interactions have become multi-step paths in our attribution graph, which can then be reasoned about in interpretable ways. Next, a significant amount of it must have gone into the frozen components, factored into separate questions we haven't tried to address here, but at least know remain. But there is also a bad option: some of it may have been simplified by our CLT taking a non-mechanistically faithful shortcut, which approximates MLP computation with a linear approximation that is often correct.</d-footnote><d-footnote>Our setup allows for some similar principled notions of linear interaction in the global context, but we now have to think of different weights for interactions along different paths – for example, what is the interaction of feature A and feature B mediated by attention head H? This is discussed in <a href='#global-weights'>§&nbsp;Global Weights</a>. The <span style='font-style: italic;'>Framework</span> paper also <a href='https://transformer-circuits.pub/2021/framework/index.html#additional-intuition'>discussed</a> these general conceptual issues in the appendix.</d-footnote></li></ul>
<p>There are other choices we made for convenience, or as a first step towards a more general solution:</p>
<ul><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'><span style='font-weight: 700;'>We collapse attention paths.</span> Every edge in our attribution graph is the direct interaction of a pair of features, summed over all possible direct interaction paths. Some of these paths flow primarily through the residual stream. Others flow through attention heads. We make no effort in the present work to distinguish these. This throws away a lot of interesting structure, since <span style='font-style: italic;'>which heads</span> mediated an interaction may be interesting, if they are something we understand (e.g. a successor head <d-cite key="gould2023successor"></d-cite> or induction head <d-cite key="olsson2022context"></d-cite>).<d-footnote>Analyzing the global weights mediated by a head may be interesting here. For example, an induction head might systematically move “I'm X” features to “say X” features. A successor head might systematically map “X” features to “X+1” features.</d-footnote><d-footnote>Of course, not all heads are individually interesting in the way induction heads or successor heads often are. We might suspect there are many more “attentional features” like induction and succession hiding in <span style='font-style: italic;'>superposition over attention heads</span>. If we could reveal these, there might be a much richer story.</d-footnote></li><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'><span style='font-weight: 700;'>We ignore QK-circuits.</span> In order to get our linear feature-feature interactions, we factor understanding transformers into two pieces, following <span style='font-style: italic;'>Framework</span> <d-cite key="nelhage2021mathematical"></d-cite>. First we ask about feature-feature interaction, conditional on an attention head or set of attention heads (the “OV-circuit”). But this leaves a second question of why attention heads attend to various pieces (the “QK-circuit”). In this work, we do not attempt this second half.</li><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'><span style='font-weight: 700;'>We only use a sparsity penalty and a reconstruction loss for crosscoder training.</span> While our ultimate goal is to find circuits with sparse interpretable edges, in a replacement model which is <span style='font-style: italic;'>mechanistically faithful</span> to the underlying model, we don't train explicitly for any of those goals.</li></ul>
<p>Nevertheless, our current method yielded interesting, validated mechanisms involving planning, multilingual structure, hallucinations, refusals, and more, in <a href='./biology.html'>the companion paper</a>.</p>
<p>We expect that advances in the trained, interpretable replacement model paradigm will produce quantitative improvements on graph-related metrics and qualitative improvements on the amount of model behaviors that become legible. It is possible that this will be an incremental process, where incremental improvements to CLTs and associated approaches to attention will yield incremental improvements to circuit identification, or that a radically different decomposition approach will best this method at scale at uncovering mechanisms. Regardless, we hope to enter an era where there is a clear flywheel between decomposition methods and “biology” results, where the appearance of structure in specific model investigations inspires innovations in decomposition methods, which in turn bring more model behaviors into the light.</p>
<h3>Coda: The lessons of addition</h3>
<p>Addition is one of the simplest behaviors performed by models, and because it is so structured, we can characterize every feature's activity on the full problem domain exactly. This allows us to skip the difficult step of staring at dataset examples and trying to discern what a feature is doing relative to, and what distinguishes it from other features active in similar contexts. This revealed a range of heuristics used by Haiku 3.5 (“say something ending in a 5”, “say something around 50”, “say something starting with 51”) which had been identified before by Nikankin <d-cite key="nikankin2024arithmetic"></d-cite>, together with a set of lookup table features that connect input pairs satisfying certain conditions (say, adding digits ending in 6 and 9) to the appropriate sum features satisfying the consequence on the output (say, producing a sum ending in 5). </p>
<p>However, even in this easier setting we made numerous mistakes when labeling these features from the original dataset examples alone, for example thinking a <code>_6 + _9</code> feature was itself a <code>sum = _5</code> feature based on what followed it in contexts. We also struggled to distinguish between low-precision features of different scales, and between features which were sensitive to a limited set of inputs or merely appeared to be because of a high prevalence of those inputs in our dataset. How much worse must this be when looking at dozens of gradations of refusal features! Getting more precise distinctions between features in fuzzier domains than arithmetic, whether through feature geometry or superhuman autointerpretability methods, will be necessary if we want to understand problems at the level of resolution that even today's CLTs appear to make possible.</p>
<p>Because addition is such a clear problem, we were also able to see how the features connected with each other to build parallel pathways; giving rise from simple heuristics depending on the input to more complex heuristics related to the output; going from the “Bag of Heuristics” identified by Nikankin to a “Graph of Heuristics”. The virtual weights show this computational structure, with groups of lookup table features combining to form sum features of different modularity and scale, which combine to form more precise sum features, and to eventually give the output. It seems likely that, in “fuzzier” natural language examples, we are conflating many roles played by features at different depths into overall buckets like “unknown entity” or “harmful request” or “notions of largeness” which actually serve specialized roles, and that there is actually an intricate aggregation and transformation of information taking place, just out of our understanding today.</p>

<p>The next two sections will focus on the two different stages we often use in mechanistic interpretability <d-cite key="olah2020zoom"></d-cite>: identifying features and then analyzing the circuits they form. Following that, we'll turn our attention to past work on the "biology" of neural networks.</p>
<h3>Feature Discovery Methods</h3>
<p>A fundamental challenge in circuit discovery is finding suitable units of analysis <d-cite key="sharkey2025open"></d-cite>. The network's natural components—attention heads and neurons—lack interpretability due to superposition <d-cite key="elhage2022superposition,olah2023distributed"></d-cite>, making the identification of better analytical units a central problem in the field.</p>
<p><span style='font-weight: 700;'>Sparse Dictionary </span><span style='font-weight: 700;'>Learning</span><span style='font-weight: 700;'> </span>is a technique with a long history originally developed by neuroscientists to analyze neural recording data <d-cite key="olshausen1997sparse"></d-cite>. Recent work <d-cite key="yun2021transformer,bricken2023monosemanticity,cunningham2023sparse,gao2024scaling,rajamanoharan2024jumping,templeton2024scaling"></d-cite> has applied Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) <d-cite key="ng2011sparse,frey2014topk"></d-cite> as a scalable solution to address superposition by learning dictionaries that decompose language model <span style='font-style: italic;'>representations</span>. While SAEs have been successfully scaled to frontier models <d-cite key="gao2024scaling,templeton2024scaling"></d-cite>, researchers have identified several methodological limitations including feature shrinkage <d-cite key="wright2024feature"></d-cite>, feature absorption <d-cite key="chanin2024absorption,bussmann2024meta"></d-cite>, lack of canonicalization <d-cite key="leask2025sparse,kissane2024saes,paulo2025sparse"></d-cite>, automating feature interpretation <d-cite key="bills2023language,paulo2024automatically,heap2025sparse"></d-cite>, and poor performance on downstream classification and steering tasks <d-cite key="kantamneni2025sparse,wu2025axbench"></d-cite>.</p>
<p>For circuit analysis specifically, SAEs are suboptimal because they decompose representations rather than <span style='font-style: italic;'>computations</span>. <span style='font-weight: 700;'>Transcoders</span> <d-cite key="dunefsky2024transcoders,marks2024dictionary,templeton2024predicting,ge2024automatically"></d-cite> address this limitation by predicting the <span style='font-style: italic;'>output</span> of nonlinear components from their inputs. Bridging over nonlinearities like this enables direct computation of pairwise feature interactions without relying on attributions or ablations through intermediate nonlinearities.</p>
<p>The space of dictionary learning approaches is large, and we remain very excited about work which explores this space and addresses methodological issues. Recent work has explored architectural modifications like multilayer feature learning <d-cite key="lindsey2024crosscoders,lawson2024residual"></d-cite>, adding skip connections <d-cite key="paulo2025transcoders"></d-cite>, incorporating gradient information <d-cite key="olmo2024features"></d-cite>, adding stronger hierarchical inductive biases <d-cite key="nabeshima2024matryoshka,bussmann2024matryoshka"></d-cite>, and further increasing computational efficiency with mixtures-of-experts <d-cite key="mudide2024efficient"></d-cite>. The community has also studied alternative training protocols to learn dictionaries that respect downstream activations <d-cite key="braun2025identifying"></d-cite>, reduce feature shrinkage <d-cite key="rajamanoharan2024improving,wright2024feature"></d-cite>, and make downstream computational interactions sparse <d-cite key="farnik2025jacobian"></d-cite>. To measure this methodological progress, a number of benchmarks and standardized evaluation protocols for assessing dictionary learning methods have been developed <d-cite key="makelov2024towards,huang2024ravel,karvonen2025measuring,chaudhary2024evaluating,wu2025axbench,karvonensaebench,karvonen2024evaluating"></d-cite>. We think circuit-based metrics will be the next frontier in dictionary learning evaluation.</p>
<p>Beyond dictionary learning, several alternative unsupervised approaches to extracting computational units have shown initial success in small-scale settings. These include transforming activations into the <span style='font-style: italic;'>local interaction basis</span> <d-cite key="bushnaq2024local,bushnaq2024using"></d-cite> and developing attribution-based decompositions of parameters <d-cite key="braun2025interpretability"></d-cite>.</p>
<h3>Circuit Discovery Methods</h3>
<p><span style='font-weight: 700;'>Definitions.</span> Throughout the literature, the term circuit is used to mean many different things. Olah <span style='font-style: italic;'>et al.</span> <d-cite key="olah2020zoom"></d-cite> introduced the definition as a subgraph of a neural network where nodes are directions in activation space and edges are the weights between them. This definition has been relaxed over time in some parts of the literature and is often used to refer to a general subgraph of network components with edge weights computed from an attribution or intervention of some kind <d-cite key="wang2022interpretability,conmy2023towards"></d-cite>.</p>
<p>There are several dimensions along which circuit approaches and definitions vary:</p>
<ul><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'>Are the units of analysis globally interpretable or not? (For example, compare monosemantic features versus an entire attention head which does many different things across the data distribution.)</li><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'>Is the circuit itself (i.e. the edge connections) a global description, or a locally valid attribution graph? Or something else?</li><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'>Are the edges interpretable? (For example, are the edges computed by linear attributions or a complex nonlinear intervention?)</li><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'>Does the approach naturally address superposition?</li></ul>
<p>We believe the North Star of circuit research is to manifest an object with globally interpretable units connected by interpretable edges which are globally valid. The present work falls short by only offering a locally valid attribution graph.</p>
<p><span style='font-weight: 700;'>Manual Analysis. </span>Early circuit discovery was largely manual, requiring specific hypotheses and bespoke methods of validation <d-cite key="cammarata2020curve,nelhage2021mathematical,olsson2022context,wang2022interpretability,nanda2023progress"></d-cite>. Causal mediation analysis <d-cite key="vig2020investigating"></d-cite>, activation patching <d-cite key="meng2022locating,zhang2023towards,heimersheim2024use"></d-cite>, patch patching <d-cite key="wang2022interpretability,goldowsky2023localizing"></d-cite>, and distributed alignment search <d-cite key="geiger2024finding,wu2023interpretability"></d-cite> have been the the most commonly used techniques for refining hypotheses and isolating causal pathways in direct analyses. However, these techniques generally do not provide interpretable (i.e. linear) edge weights between units.</p>
<p><span style='font-weight: 700;'>Automatic Analysis. </span>These analyses were automated in Conmy<span style='font-style: italic;'> et al.</span> <d-cite key="conmy2023towards"></d-cite> by developing a recursive patching procedure to automatically find component subgraphs given a task of interest. However, patching analyses are computationally expensive, requiring a forward pass per step. This motivated <span style='font-style: italic;'>attribution</span> patching <d-cite key="nanda2023patching,syed2023attributionpatching"></d-cite>, a more efficient method leveraging gradients to approximate the effect of interventions. There has been significant follow up work on attribution patching including improving the gradient approximation<d-cite key="kramar2024atpstar,hanna2024have,zhang2025eap"></d-cite>, adapting the techniques to vision models <d-cite key="rajaram2024automatic"></d-cite>, and incorporating positional information <d-cite key="haklay2025position"></d-cite>. Other techniques studied in the literature include learned masking techniques<d-cite key="cao2021low,davies2023discovering,bhaskar2025finding"></d-cite>, circuit probing <d-cite key="lepori2023uncovering"></d-cite>, discretization <d-cite key="o2024sparse"></d-cite>, and information flow analysis <d-cite key="ferrando2024information,katz2023visit"></d-cite>. The objective of many of these automated approaches is isolating important model components (i.e., layers, neurons, attention heads) and the interactions between them, but they do not address the interpretation of these components.</p>
<p>However, armed with better computational units of analysis from sparse dictionary learning, this work and other recent papers <d-cite key="dunefsky2024transcoders,ge2024automatically,marks2024sparse,he2024dictionary"></d-cite> are making a return to discovering connections between interpretable components. Specifically, our work is most similar to Dunefsky et al. <d-cite key="dunefsky2024transcoders"></d-cite> and Ge et al. <d-cite key="ge2024automatically"></d-cite> who also use transcoders to compute per-prompt attribution graphs with stop-gradients while also studying input-agnostic global weights. Our work is different in that we use crosscoders to absorb redundant features, use a more global pruning algorithm, include error nodes <d-cite key="marks2024sparse"></d-cite>, and use a more powerful visualization suite to enable deeper qualitative analysis. These works are closer in spirit to the original circuits vision outlined in Olah<span style='font-style: italic;'> et al.</span> <d-cite key="olah2020zoom"></d-cite>, but inherit prompt specific quantities (e.g. attention patterns) that limit their generality.</p>
<p><span style='font-weight: 700;'>Attention Circuits. </span>The attention mechanism in transformers introduced challenges for weight-based circuit analysis as done by Olah <span style='font-style: italic;'>et al.</span> <d-cite key="olah2020zoom"></d-cite>. Elhage <span style='font-style: italic;'>et al.</span> <d-cite key="nelhage2021mathematical"></d-cite> proposed decomposing attention layers into a <span style='font-style: italic;'>nonlinear</span> QK component controlling the attention pattern, and a <span style='font-style: italic;'>linear</span> OV component which controls the output. By freezing QK (e.g., for a particular prompt), transcoder feature-feature interactions mediated by attention become linear. This is the approach adopted by this work and Dunefsky et al. <d-cite key="dunefsky2024transcoders"></d-cite>. Others have tried training SAEs on the attention outputs <d-cite key="kissane2024attncirc,marks2024sparse,he2024dictionary"></d-cite> and multiplying features through key and query matrices to explain attention patterns <d-cite key="ge2024automatically"></d-cite>.</p>
<p><span style='font-weight: 700;'>Replacement Models. </span>Our notion of a replacement model is similar in spirit to past work on causal abstraction <d-cite key="geiger2021causal,geiger2023causal"></d-cite> and proxy models <d-cite key="wu2023causal,shah2024decomposing"></d-cite>. These methods seek to learn an interpretable graphical model which maintains faithfulness to an underlying black box model. However, these techniques typically require a task specification or other supervision, as opposed to our replacement model which is learned in a fully unsupervised manner.</p>
<p><span style='font-weight: 700;'>Circuit Evaluation</span>. Causal scrubbing <d-cite key="chan2022causal"></d-cite> was proposed as an early principled approach for evaluating interpretation quality through behavior-preserving resampling ablations. Shi <span style='font-style: italic;'>et al.</span> <d-cite key="shi2025hypothesis"></d-cite> formalized criteria for evaluating circuit hypotheses, focusing on behavior preservation, localization, and minimality, while applying these tests to both synthetic and discovered circuits in transformer models. However, Miller <span style='font-style: italic;'>et al.</span> <d-cite key="miller2024transformer"></d-cite> raised important concerns about existing faithfulness metrics, finding them highly sensitive to seemingly insignificant changes in ablation methodology.</p>
<h3>Circuit Biology and Phenomenology</h3>
<p>Beyond methods, many works have performed deep case studies and uncovered interesting model phenomenology. For example, thorough circuit analysis has been performed on</p>
<ul><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'>Arithmetic in toy models <d-cite key="nanda2023progress,zhong2023clock,chughtai2023toy,stander2023grokking,li2024fourier"></d-cite></li><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'>Python doc strings <d-cite key="heimersheim2023circuit"></d-cite></li><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'>Indirect object identification <d-cite key="wang2022interpretability"></d-cite></li><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'>Computing the greater-than operator <d-cite key="hanna2023does"></d-cite></li><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'>Multiple Choice <d-cite key="lieberum2023does"></d-cite></li><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'>Pronoun gender <d-cite key="vig2020investigating,mathwin2023identifying,chintam2023identifying"></d-cite></li><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'>In-context learning <d-cite key="kharlapenko2025scaling"></d-cite></li></ul>
<p>The growing set of case studies has enabled further research on how these components are used in other tasks <d-cite key="merullo2023circuit,mondorf2024circuit"></d-cite>. Moreover, Tigges <span style='font-style: italic;'>et al.</span> <d-cite key="tigges2024llm"></d-cite> found that many of these circuit analyses are consistent across training and scale. Preceding these analyses, there has also been a long line of “Bertology” research that has studied model biology (<span style='font-style: italic;'>see survey</span> <d-cite key="rogers2020primer"></d-cite>) using attention pattern analysis and probing.</p>

<h4><a id='appendix-ml-details-plausible' href='#appendix-ml-details-plausible'>Estimated Compute Requirements for CLT Training</a></h4>
<p>To give a rough sense of compute requirements to train CLTs, we share some estimated costs for CLTs on the Gemma 2 series of models <d-cite key="team2024gemma,lieberum2024gemmascope"></d-cite>. On the 2B parameter model, a run with 2M features and 1B train tokens would require 3.8e20 training flops (roughly 210 H100 hours at 50% flops efficiency). On the 9B parameter model a run with 5M features and 3B train tokens would require 6.9e21 training flops (roughly 3,844 H100 hours at 50% flops efficiency).</p>
<h4><a id='appendix-ml-details-ml' href='#appendix-ml-details-ml'>ML details</a></h4>
<p>We train our cross-layer transcoder using a combination of mean-squared error reconstruction loss on MLP outputs and a Tanh sparsity penalty. Our features use the JumpReLU nonlinearity <d-cite key="rajamanoharan2024jumping"></d-cite>. We found the combination of JumpReLU + Tanh to modestly outperform alternative methods on MSE/L0, but we suspect that alternative choices of nonlinearity and sparsity penalty could perform comparably well. For more details on our training setup see <d-cite key="conerly2025optimization"></d-cite>. Here we highlight methodological details that differ from our prior work on SAEs:</p>
<ul><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'>Following <d-cite key="lindsey2024crosscoders"></d-cite>, we separately normalize the activation of each residual stream layer and each MLP output prior to using them as inputs / targets for the cross-layer transcoder. </li><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'>For our nonlinearity, we use the JumpReLU activation function with a straight-through gradient estimator <d-cite key="rajamanoharan2024jumping"></d-cite>. However, we deviate from Rajamanoharan <span style='font-style: italic;'>et al.</span> in several respects. First, we use a much higher bandwidth parameter (1.0) for the straight through estimator and a much higher initial JumpReLU threshold (0.03). Second, we allow the gradient to flow through the JumpReLU nonlinearity to all model parameters, rather than only the threshold parameter. We found these decisions improved the MSE/L0 frontier in our setup.</li><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'>We schedule our sparsity penalty to linearly ramp up from 0 to its final value throughout the entire duration of training. In previous work, the ramp-up phase took place over a small initial fraction of training steps.</li><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'>We introduce a new “pre-activation loss” of <d-math>\sum_f \text{ReLU}(-h_f)</d-math> where h_f is the pre-nonlinearity activation of feature f. We found this loss helps prevent dead features on large CLT runs. We only used this loss for our experiments on Haiku 3.5, with a coefficient of 3×10⁻⁶.</li></ul>
<p>We chose our number of training steps to scale slightly sublinearly with the number of features, and our learning rate to scale approximately as one over the square root of the number of FLOPs. These are rough best-guess estimates based on prior experiments, and not precise scaling laws. In our largest 18L run, we used ~3B training tokens. In our largest Haiku run, we used ~16B training tokens.</p>
<p>In 18L, we used a constant sparsity penalty across CLT sizes. In Haiku, we increased the penalty with the CLT size (we found that otherwise, the L0 of the runs increased with size). In general we targeted L0 values in the low hundreds, based on preliminary investigation of what produced interpretable results in our graph interface.</p>
<p>Our 18L model is a pretraining-only model, and thus we used only pretraining data when training CLTs for it. For Haiku, by contrast, we trained the CLT using a mix of pretraining and finetuning data.</p>
<p>Encoder parameters are initialized by sampling from <d-math>U(\frac{-1}{\sqrt{\text{n\_features}}}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{\text{n\_features}}})</d-math> and decoder parameters are initialized by sampling from <d-math>U(\frac{-1}{\sqrt{\text{n\_layers}\,\cdot\,\text{d\_model}}}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{\text{n\_layers}\,\cdot\,\text{d\_model}}})</d-math>.</p>
<p>We shuffle our training data at the token level. We’ve found that not shuffling leads to significantly worse performance. We suspect a variety of partial shuffles, such as the one used in <d-cite key="lieberum2024gemmascope"></d-cite>, could perform just as well as a full shuffle.</p>
<h4><a id='appendix-ml-details-eng' href='#appendix-ml-details-eng'>Engineering & Infrastructure Considerations</a></h4>
<p>Here we share some engineering considerations relevant to training CLTs at scale – in particular, how it differs from training standard transcoders (“per-layer transcoders”, PLTs).</p>
<p>In our training implementation, the key difference between PLTs and CLTs is that, <span style='font-style: italic;'>per </span><span style='font-style: italic;'>accelerator</span><span style='font-style: italic;'> (GPU, TPU, etc)</span>, they use the same number of FLOPS, but the CLT uses n_layers times more network bandwidth. Thus when training CLTs more time should be spent profiling and optimizing network operations. This isn’t obvious, so we work through the details below.</p>
<p>In our training setup, features are sharded across accelerators. For each batch:</p>
<ol><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'>Each accelerator receives input and target activations.</li><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'>Each accelerator computes partial predictions based on the features it stores.</li><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'>An all-reduce operation is performed across all accelerators to combine these partial predictions.</li><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'>Each accelerator then runs a backward pass and performs a gradient step using the combined predictions. A constant fraction of each accelerator's high bandwidth memory (HBM) is dedicated to parameters, with the remainder used for intermediate computations.</li></ol>
<p>PLTs and CLTs have the same number of parameters per accelerator because the same fraction of HBM is dedicated to parameters. The number of FLOPS scales with batch size multiplied by the number of parameters so PLTs and CLTs use the same FLOPS <span style='font-style: italic;'>per accelerator</span>. If a PLT and a CLT have the same number of features then the CLT would have more total parameters, use more accelerators, and use more total FLOPS, but FLOPS per accelerator would be the same.</p>
<p><br></br></p>
<p>Some optimizations to consider:</p>
<ul><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'>Have each accelerator load a different training batch. When it’s time to train on a batch, the accelerator that loaded it broadcasts it to all other accelerators using fast accelerator-to-accelerator comms.</li><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'>Broadcast the batch for the next training step during the backwards pass of the previous training step.</li><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'>Fetch future training batches in the background while training.</li><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'>Use lower precision (e.g. bfloat16) to reduce the amount of data sent.</li></ul>
<p>We store activations to a distributed file system, then load them during training. Both CLTs and PLTs on every layer require activations from every layer of the underlying model. Thus we’ve optimized our code that collects activations for that use case. Collecting activations from all layers requires the same FLOPs as collecting from a single layer, but n_layers times more network bandwidth.</p>
<p>A possible optimization we didn’t implement is sparse kernels from <d-cite key="gao2024scaling"></d-cite>. The decoder forward, decoder backward, and encoder backward passes only operate on active features, so with the proper sparse kernels, FLOPS would be significantly reduced. CLTs have the same number of encoder parameters and FLOPS as PLTs, but n_layers/2 times more decoder parameters and FLOPS. Thus this optimization is more important for CLTs. This optimization makes it more likely that network operations will be the training bottleneck. Note that JumpReLU’s straight-through estimator has nonzero gradients on inactive features. We think it’s plausible that that isn’t important or we could switch to a different nonlinearity, but we haven’t tried it.</p>
<p>Another possible optimization we didn’t implement is to change how the decoder is sharded to remove the all-reduce. We could shard the encoder over features and shard the decoder over the output dimension. The all-reduce is removed because each decoder shard computes the MSE over a slice of the output dimension. Each decoder shard needs access to all active features, so an all-to-all is needed to share all active features with all shards. Another all-to-all is required on the backward pass. Given feature sparsity, these network operations are much smaller than the all-reduce.</p>
<h4><a id='appendix-ml-details-efficiency' href='#appendix-ml-details-efficiency'>Efficiency relative to alternatives</a></h4>
<p>Compared to alternatives like per-layer transcoders (PLTs), CLTs use more parameters – the same number of encoder parameters, but approximately n_layers/2 times as many decoder parameters.  Thus, even if CLTs provide value beyond PLTs with the same number of <span style='font-style: italic;'>features</span>, it is reasonable to ask whether they perform better at a fixed training <span style='font-style: italic;'>cost</span>. Empirically, we find that CLTs perform better (according to some metrics) or comparably (according to others) than PLTs at a fixed cost, even without the use of sparse kernels (which, as noted above, advantage CLTs more than PLTs). Broadly, this is because the number of <span style='font-style: italic;'>total features</span> (across all layers) required to achieve a given level of performance is much less for CLTs than SLTs, which compensates for their additional per-feature cost. In more detail:</p>
<ul><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'>Note that in our experiments on the 18L model, we ran CLTs and sets-of-PLTs with 300K, 1M, 3M, and 10M total features. Note that we also scaled training steps along with n_features. Coincidentally, this meant that the number of FLOPs used by our PLT runs were comparable to the number of FLOPS used by the “next size smaller” CLT run (i.e. 10M PLT ≈ 3M CLT, etc.).  </li><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'>Comparing approximately FLOPs-matched PLT and CLT runs on our various <a href='#evaluating'>evaluations</a>, we notice that:</li></ul>
<ul><li style='margin-left: 72pt;'>In terms of (MSE, L0) and (replacement model KL divergence, L0), the 1M feature CLT strictly outperforms the 10M feature set-of-PLTs, using 5–10× less compute.</li><li style='margin-left: 72pt;'>What about feature interpretability scores?</li></ul>
<ul><li style='margin-left: 108pt;'>If we compare the 3M feature CLT to the 10M set-of-PLTs (roughly FLOPs equivalent), the CLT attains somewhat lower MSE and KL divergence and roughly equal Sort Eval scores.</li><li style='margin-left: 108pt;'>The picture for the Contrastive Eval is less clear.  The 3M feature CLT attains lower MSE and KL divergence than the 10M feature PLTs, but higher worse Contrastive Eval scores. Thus we cannot declare a Pareto-winner here (we would need to run a sweep over the sparsity penalty to make the judgment).</li></ul>
<ul><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'>We have found that cross-layer dictionaries require a comparable order of magnitude of training tokens to single-layer dictionaries (a rough estimate based on our 18L experiments is that they benefit from ~2 times more tokens).</li></ul>
<p>Thus, it seems that overall, CLTs are at least as cost-effective as PLTs (and presumably per-layer SAEs, which have the same parameter-count as PLTs) to reach a given level of circuit understanding, and likely moreso. However, if another group finds PLTs to be easier to implement or more cost-effective, we expect it’s possible to find interesting results using PLTs as well. We expect that even making attribution graphs with raw neurons will yield plenty of interesting insights.</p>
<p>We also note that optimizations could make CLTs even more cost-effective – as discussed <a href='#appendix-ml-details-eng'>above</a>, implementing sparse kernels and communications could in principle reduce the number of FLOPs performed by CLTs by a factor of up to n_layers/2.</p>
<p>We suspect there are potential algorithmic optimizations to be made as well. For instance, it is possible that most of the benefits of CLTs can be captured by learning layer-to-layer linear transformations that are common to <span style='font-style: italic;'>all</span> features, eliminating the need for each feature to have its own independent decoder parameters for every downstream model layer.</p>
<h3><a id='appendix-attribution-graph-computation' href='#appendix-attribution-graph-computation'>Attribution Graph Computation</a></h3>
<p>We give complete definitions of nodes and edges in the attribution graph, continuing the discussion in the <a href='#graphs-constructing'>main text</a>. Associated to each node type are two (sets of) vectors: input vectors, which affect the edges for which the node is a target, and output vectors, which affect the edges for which the node is a source.</p>
<ul><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'>The output node corresponding to a vocabulary token <d-math>\text{tok}</d-math> has candidate output tokens has input vector <d-math>v_{in} = \nabla (\mathbf{logit}_\text{tok} - \overline{\mathbf{logit}})</d-math>, the gradient of the pre-softmax logit for the target token minus the mean logit.</li><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'>A feature node corresponding to feature <d-math>s</d-math> at context position <d-math>c_s</d-math> has a set of output vectors  <d-math>v_{out}^\ell = W_{\text{dec}, \;s}^{\ell_s \to \ell}</d-math>, for <d-math>\ell_s \leq \ell</d-math>. It has input vector <d-math>v_{in}^\ell = W_{\text{enc}, \;s}^{\ell_s}</d-math>.</li><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'>An embedding node corresponding to input token <d-math>\text{tok}</d-math> has output vector <d-math>v_{out} = \text{Emb}_{\text{tok}}</d-math>.</li><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'>An error node at context position <d-math>c</d-math> and layer <d-math>\ell</d-math> has output vector <d-math>v_{out} = \text{MLP}_\ell (x_{c,\ell}) - \text{CLT}_\ell(x_c)</d-math> where <d-math>x</d-math> represents the full residual stream vector at all context positions and layers from a forward pass of the underlying model, <d-math>\text{MLP}_{c, \ell}</d-math> is the output of the layer <d-math>\ell</d-math> MLP, and <d-math>\text{CLT}_\ell</d-math> is the output of the CLT to layer <d-math>\ell</d-math>.</li></ul>
<p>For edges from embedding or error nodes to feature or output nodes, the edge weight is:</p>
<p><d-math block>A_{s \rightarrow t} = v_{out, s}^T J_{c_s, \ell_s \rightarrow c_t, \ell_t}^{\blacktriangledown} v_{in, t}.</d-math></p>
<p>For edges from feature nodes to feature or output nodes, the edge weight is </p>
<p><d-math block sub>A_{s \rightarrow t} = a_s \sum_{\ell_s \leq \ell < \ell_t} (v_{out}^\ell)^T J_{c_s, \ell \rightarrow c_t, \ell_t}^{\blacktriangledown} v_{in, t}.</d-math></p>
<p>The Jacobian <d-math>J_{c_s,  \ell_s \rightarrow c_t, \ell_t}^{\blacktriangledown}</d-math> can be expanded into a sum over all paths of length <d-math>\ell_t - \ell_s</d-math> in the underlying model through attention heads and residual connections. Consider a path <d-math>p</d-math> starting at position <d-math>c_s</d-math> and layer <d-math>\ell_s</d-math> and ending at position <d-math>c_t</d-math> and layer <d-math>\ell_t</d-math> consisting of <d-math>i = 1, 2, \ldots, (\ell_t - \ell_s)</d-math> steps, each of which is either a residual stream step going from layer <d-math>\ell + i - 1</d-math> to <d-math>\ell + i</d-math> or an attention head step going from position <d-math>c_i</d-math> to <d-math>c_{i+1}</d-math> via attention head <d-math>h_i</d-math> with attention weight <d-math>a^{h_i}_{c_i \rightarrow c_{i+1}}</d-math> and applying transformation <d-math>OV_{h_i}</d-math>. Each step is associated to a linear transformation <d-math>\pi_i</d-math> which is the identity for a residual stream step and <d-math>a^{h_i}_{c_i \rightarrow c_{i+1}} OV_{h_i}</d-math> for an attention step. The whole path <d-math>p</d-math> is thus associated to a linear transformation <d-math>\pi_p = \prod_i \pi_i</d-math>. Then we can write</p>
<p><d-math block sub> J_{c_s, \ell_s \rightarrow c_t, \ell_t}^{\blacktriangledown} = \sum_{p \in \mathcal{P}(c_s, c_t, \ell_s, \ell_t)} \pi_p</d-math></p>
<p>where <d-math>\mathcal{P}(c_s, c_t, \ell_s, \ell_t)</d-math> is the set of all paths starting at position <d-math>c_s</d-math> and layer <d-math>\ell_s</d-math> and ending at position <d-math>c_t</d-math> and layer <d-math>\ell_t</d-math>.</p>
<p>To compute the graph edges in practice, we iterate over target nodes in the graph (output or feature nodes). For each node we:</p>
<ul><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'>Inject the input vector for the node into the residual stream. For CLT features, we inject the encoder of the target CLT feature in the residual stream at the layer and token position where it reads. For logit nodes, we instead inject the gradient of the logit (minus the mean logit) at the final layer residual stream.</li><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'>Do a backwards pass in the underlying model with</li></ul>
<ul><li style='margin-left: 72pt;'>stop-gradient operators on the MLP outputs, and</li><li style='margin-left: 72pt;'>normalization denominators and attention patterns set to values recorded from the underlying model's forward pass on the prompt.</li></ul>
<ul><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'>For a CLT source node (feature, token position), we take the sum of the dot products of its decoder vector in each layer with the gradient in that layer, times the activation of that feature.</li><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'>For an embedding or error source node, we simply take the product of its vector with the gradient.</li></ul>
<p>The cost to compute the graph is linear in the number of active features in the prompt, and is dominated by the cost of the underlying model backwards pass. To economize, we sometimes compute the graph adaptively: starting from the output nodes for the logits, then maintaining a queue of the feature nodes with the greatest influence on the logit, and computing the input edges for nodes based on their order in the queue. This allows us to compute the most important parts of the graph first.</p>
<h3><a id='appendix-graph-pruning' href='#appendix-graph-pruning'>Graph Pruning</a></h3>
<p>To increase the signal to noise ratio of our manual interpretation, we rely heavily on a graph pruning step to reduce the number of nodes and edges in the graph. We employ a two-step algorithm which first prunes the nodes and then prunes the edges of the remaining nodes. The details are as follows:</p>
<ul><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'>We take the adjacency matrix of the graph and replace all the edge weights with their absolute values to obtain an unsigned adjacency matrix. Then we normalize the input edges to each node so that they sum to 1. Let A refer to this normalized, unsigned adjacency matrix.</li><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'>We compute the <span style='font-style: italic;'>indirect influence matrix </span><d-math>B = A + A^2 + A^3 + \cdots</d-math> which can be efficiently computed as <d-math>B = (I - A)^{-1} - I</d-math>. The entries of <d-math>B</d-math> indicate the sum of the strengths of all paths between a given pair of nodes, where the strength of any given path is given by the product of the values of its constituent edges in A.</li><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'>We take the rows of <d-math>B</d-math> corresponding to logit nodes, and take their weighted average, weighting according to the model’s output probabilities for each token. This results in a vector of <span style='font-style: italic;'>logit influence scores</span> for each node in the graph.</li><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'>We sort the logit influence scores of non-logit nodes in descending order and choose the minimum cutoff index such that the sum of the influence scores prior to the cutoff divided by the total sum exceeds a given threshold. We use a threshold of 0.8 unless otherwise noted. We prune away all non-logit nodes after the cutoff.</li><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'>With the pruned graph, we re-compute a normalized unsigned adjacency matrix and logit influence scores for each node using the same method as above. Then we assign a logit influence score to each <span style='font-style: italic;'>edge</span> by multiplying the logit influence score of the edge’s output node by the normalized edge weight. We prune edges according to the same strategy as for nodes, but using a higher cutoff 0.98 unless otherwise noted.</li><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'>Logit nodes are pruned separately. We keep the logit nodes corresponding to the top <d-math>K</d-math> most likely token outputs, where <d-math>K</d-math> is chosen so that the total probability of the logit nodes is greater than 0.95. If this would result in <d-math>K > 10</d-math>, we clamp <d-math>K</d-math> to <d-math>10</d-math>.</li><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'>Embedding nodes and error nodes are not pruned.</li></ul>
<p>We include pseudocode below. Our pruning thresholds can, very roughly speaking, be interpreted as determining the percent of “total logit influence” we lose from pruning. That is, we choose the subset of nodes that are responsible for ~80% of the influence on the logits, and the subset of their input edges responsible for ~98% of the remaining influence. Our choice of thresholds is arbitrary and was chosen manually to balance preservation of important paths with the need to prune graphs to a manageable, interpretable size.</p>
<p>For longer prompts, we can also employ an adaptive algorithm, to greedily construct a graph out of the most influential nodes, rather than generating the full graph only to prune most of it away. To do so, we maintain a set of <span style='font-style: italic;'>explored</span> nodes (i.e., nodes from which we have computed backward attributions) and an estimate of the most influential nodes, where <span style='font-style: italic;'>unexplored</span> nodes count as errors. At each step, we compute the top <d-math>k</d-math> most influential nodes using our influence scores, and attribute back from these. We terminate when a target number of nodes have been explored.</p>
<p>With our default parameters, pruned graphs are substantially smaller than the original raw graphs; the number of nodes typically decreases by ~10× and the number of edges typically decreases by ~500× (the exact numbers are sensitive to prompt length).</p>

<h3><a id='appendix-lrm-validation' href='#appendix-lrm-validation'>Validating the Replacement Model</a></h3>
<h4><a id='appendix-lrm-validation-node' href='#appendix-lrm-validation-node'>Validating Node-to-Logit Influence</a></h4>
<p>We rely on indirect influence statistics for pruning, adaptive generation, and our graph statistics. In this section, we validate that indirect influence is a better proxy for “importance” than other basic baselines like activation or logit attribution (with stop grads).</p>
<p>Specifically, on a sample of 20 prompts, we compute the effect of ablating every feature and measure the KL divergence between the model with the ablation and the clean forward pass. We perform this intervention using “constrained” patching, so we also sweep over different ranges of layers to apply the intervention. In the plot below, we report the average log-log Pearson correlation between ablation KL and initial activation, direct logit edge weight, and indirect influence on the logit. We see that node influence is most predictive of ablation effect, followed by direct edge weights. Both outperform a simple activation baseline.</p>
<div class='sn-figma-div' data-args='{"figma_slug":"node-influence-correlation-svg"}'></div>
<h4><a id='appendix-lrm-validation-edges' href='#appendix-lrm-validation-edges'>Validating Feature-to-feature Influence</a></h4>
<p>We can use edges in the attribution graphs to estimate the influence features should have on each other. However, if the replacement model is unfaithful or incomplete, a perturbation experiment might not yield results which are consistent with an estimate based on graph influence. For example, initially inactive components could engage in self-correction and dampen the effect of the perturbation. To estimate the extent to which this happens in our graphs, we measure how often perturbations have the expected effect by ablating every feature in the graph, and recording the activation of features downstream of it. Our ablations are done using constrained patching in the range <d-math>[i, i+2]</d-math> where <d-math>i</d-math> is the encoder layer of the feature being perturbed (note this choice of layer is arbitrary, see further discussion <a href='#appendix-cross-layer-steering'>here</a>). When averaged over a dataset of 20 prompts, we find a Spearman correlation of 0.72 between the influence of a source feature on a target feature as described by the graph, and the effect of ablating said feature on the target feature’s activation (where we normalize by the original activation and take the absolute value since influence is unsigned). We include scatter plots from three examples from the paper:</p>
<div class='sn-figma-div' data-args='{"figma_slug":"edge-influence-correlation-svg"}'></div>
<p>These figures show that there are relatively few points that (1) have large influence and no ablation effect (lower right) and (2) have low influence but high ablation effect (upper left). This suggests that indirect influence through the graph is a fairly good proxy for real effects in the model.</p>
<h4><a id='appendix-lrm-validation-faithfulness' href='#appendix-lrm-validation-faithfulness'>Evaluating Faithfulness of the Local Replacement Model</a></h4>
<p>In this work, we use (local) replacement models as a window into the mechanisms of the original model. This approach is problematic if the (local) replacement model uses very different mechanisms than the original model. In the main text, we performed perturbations of features to confirm specific mechanistic theories and measured how well the replacement model's outputs matched the underlying model's outputs. Here, we focus on how well their inner states match in response to a broader set of perturbations, including off-distribution perturbations, as an (imperfect) gauge of the replacement model’s quality.</p>
<p>We use the local replacement model (i.e. with reconstruction errors added back in as constant factors, and attention patterns frozen<d-footnote>We also freeze attention patterns in the underlying model.</d-footnote>), ensuring agreement of the replacement and original models under zero-size perturbations. Like <a href='#appendix-patching'>“iterative patching,”</a> the replacement model may respond to perturbations by activating features which were not previously active at baseline.<br></br></p>
<p>We perturb the models at single token positions using 3 types of perturbations: adding a feature’s encoder-vector to the residual stream, adding random directions to the residual stream, and perturbing an upstream feature (to be defined precisely below).</p>
<p>Broadly, averaging across choices of intervention layers, we find that:</p>
<ul><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'>Perturbation results are reasonably similar between the replacement model and the underlying model when measured one layer after the intervention.</li><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'>Perturbation discrepancies compound significantly over layers.</li><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'>Compounding errors have a gradually detrimental effect on the faithfulness of the <span style='font-style: italic;'>direction</span> of perturbation effects, which are largely consistent across CLT sizes, with signs of faithfulness worsening slightly as dictionary size increases.</li><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'>Compounding errors can have a catastrophically detrimental effect on the <span style='font-style: italic;'>magnitude </span>of perturbations. This effect is worse for larger dictionaries.</li></ul>
<p><span style='font-weight: 700;'>To measure faithfulness for perturbations in encoder directions</span>: </p>
<ul><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'>We first choose a residual-stream layer and select a random active feature with an encoder-vector in that layer.</li><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'>We take the encoder-vector of the chosen feature, and add a multiple of it (see next bullet) to the residual stream of both the replacement model and frozen underlying model. </li><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'>This perturbation to the residual is scaled to increase the chosen feature’s activation to 0.1 above its original value.</li><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'>After modifying the residual stream, we perform the forward pass of both perturbed models.</li></ul>
<p><span style='font-weight: 700;'>To measure faithfulness for perturbations in random directions</span>: </p>
<ul><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'>We follow the above process to determine the perturbation’s magnitude, but prior to its addition to both residual streams, the perturbation-vector is rotated to a random direction on the unit sphere.</li></ul>
<p><span style='font-weight: 700;'>To measure faithfulness for perturbations to upstream features</span>: </p>
<ul><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'>We select an active feature to perturb and an <span style='font-style: italic;'>intervention layer</span> after the feature’s encoder layer.</li><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'>We increase the feature’s activation by 0.1 and run the local replacement model with this perturbation applied, up until the intervention layer.</li><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'>At the intervention layer, we compare two forward passes:</li></ul>
<ul><li style='margin-left: 72pt;'>In one, the residual-stream state of this forward pass is copied-over to the underlying model at the intervention layer, and the underlying model is run forward from there.</li><li style='margin-left: 72pt;'>In the other, we continue the forward pass of the local replacement model.</li></ul>
<p>At each layer downstream of the perturbation, we can determine a net perturbation for both perturbed models by taking the activations from the (perturbed) forward pass and subtracting clean (un-perturbed) baseline activations. The net perturbations for each model are then compared to yield measures of faithfulness, by computing cosine-similarity and mean-squared-error between them.</p>
<p>We believe that perturbing upstream features produces the most “on-distribution” perturbations of these approaches, since random directions may fall into relatively inactive dimensions and encoder-directions are the most sensitive dimensions of the replacement model. Below are results for upstream-feature perturbations to features in layer 5 of the model, averaged over choice of the intervention layer.</p>
<div class='sn-figma-div' data-args='{"figma_slug":"faithfulness-perturbations-upstream-svg"}'></div>
<p>Below are cosine-similarity faithfulness metrics for the 10m dictionary for other choices of upstream layers and other perturbation strategies.</p>
<div class='sn-figma-div' data-args='{"figma_slug":"faithfulness-cosine-sim-svg"}'></div>
<p>As can be seen from the bottom rows of the graphic above, cosine-faithfulness of the 10m dictionary for 18L in the layer following the intervention or perturbation layer is around 60–80%. Computing the average of this bottom-row for different dictionary sizes, in the figure below, the largest dictionaries show signs of mildly diminished faithfulness for perturbations from upstream features.</p>
<div class='sn-figma-div' data-args='{"figma_slug":"faithfulness-average-cosine-svg"}'></div>
<p>The decay of faithfulness-metrics over multiple layers, at first glance, raises questions about the reliability of our interpretability graphs, analyses, and steering techniques. Indeed, these results seem at odds with the qualitatively successful results of many of the perturbation experiments we use to validate attribution graphs (both in this paper and its companion). We suspect this is due to a combination of factors:</p>
<ul><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'>The compounding unfaithfulness problem affects perturbation <span style='font-style: italic;'>magnitudes </span>more severely than <span style='font-style: italic;'>directions.</span> We compensate for this issue in practice by trying a range of perturbation strengths in ad-hoc, empirical fashion.</li><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'>Aggregating features into supernodes may help “denoise” faithfulness errors.</li><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'>The perturbation experiments we perform in the context of graph validation are highly nonrandom – we are typically perturbing and measuring “important” or “cruxy” features, and doing so in the layers where their output is strong. A proportion of the effect we observe can also be attributed to “guaranteed effects”, as we describe in <a href='#appendix-cross-layer-steering'>§&nbspNuances of Steering with Cross-Layer Features</a>.</li></ul>
<p>How do these results compare for per-layer transcoder (PLT) dictionaries? Cosine-faithfulness metrics for PLTs were broadly similar to those for CLTs. The PLT replacement model achieves lower normalized MSE at one layer after the intervention, but compounding errors in the largest PLT replacement models accumulate slightly more rapidly after several layers, as seen in the figure below. This may reflect an advantage of the CLT skip connections, which allow for shorter paths through the replacement model. </p>
<div class='sn-figma-div' data-args='{"figma_slug":"faithfulness-normalized-svg"}'></div>
<p>Normalized MSE results are sensitive to the scale of the perturbation. To make scales comparable across replacement model types for the figure above, the perturbation to the initial upstream feature in Layer 5 is scaled differently for each sample so that Layer 6 is perturbed by a constant proportion of its magnitude.</p>
<h3><a id='appendix-cross-layer-steering' href='#appendix-cross-layer-steering'>Nuances of Steering with Cross-Layer Features</a></h3>
<p>Our perturbation methodology (constrained patching and iterative patching) is somewhat non-obvious at first glance. Why don’t we simply add to the residual stream along a feature’s decoder vector at each layer as we run a forward pass of the model? The reason for this is that it risks double-counting the effect of the feature. For instance, consider a feature in layer 1, with decoders writing to layers 2, 3, and onward. It may be that the activations being reconstructed in layer 2 were, in the original model, causally upstream of the activations being reconstructed in layer 3. Thus, injecting a perturbation into layers 2 and 3 would “double up” on the feature’s effect. Across more layers, this effect could compound to be quite significant.</p>
<p>Our constrained patching approach avoids this problem by computing perturbed MLP outputs once at the outset, and then clamping MLP outputs to these precomputed values (rather than adding to the MLP outputs). While this avoids the double-counting problem, it requires us to choose an intervention layer – we apply the perturbations in all layers up to the intervention layer, but not after (otherwise we would be clamping all of the MLP outputs of the model, and thus we wouldn’t be testing any hypotheses about how the model responds to perturbations). This makes it challenging to measure “the entire effect” of a feature (see <a href='#appendix-unexplained-var'>§ Unexplained Variance &amp; Choice of Steering Factors</a>). </p>
<p>It also makes the interpretation of perturbation experiment effects somewhat awkward. Suppose a source feature is in layer 1, and our perturbation intervention layer is 5, i.e. we apply the perturbation in layers 1 through 5. This perturbation will have an impact on, say, features in layer 3. However, the “knock-on” effects of this impact will be at least partially (and perhaps completely) overwritten, since the MLP outputs at layers 4 and 5 are clamped to values computed at the outset. Note that our alternative approach to patching, <a href='#appendix-patching'>“iterative patching,”</a> does capture such knock-on effects. However, because of this, it is not as suitable as a validation of mechanisms in an attribution graph, since the perturbation is less precise.</p>
<p>Another subtle aspect of our perturbation experiments is that <span style='font-style: italic;'>direct</span> feature-feature interactions described by an attribution graph are nearly forced to be confirmed in steering experiments (when we freeze attention patterns), since they measure linear effects of source feature decoders on target feature encoders (via fixed linear weights, conditioned on frozen attention patterns) – and guaranteed when choosing the intervention layer to be the same as the target feature’s encoder layer. Thus, the nontrivial thing we are testing with perturbation experiments is the validity of the attribution graph’s claims about “knock-on effects.” That is, suppose our attribution graph tells us that feature A excites feature B, which excites feature C, which upweights token X. When we perform a perturbation experiment by inhibiting feature A, we will get an inhibitory effect on feature B “for free,” and we are interested in validating whether the subsequent effects on features C and the output token are as expected.</p>
<h3><a id='appendix-unexplained-var' href='#appendix-unexplained-var'>Unexplained Variance and Choice of Steering Factors</a></h3>
<p>Our choice of steering factor scales for intervention experiments is somewhat ad-hoc and empirically driven. For instance, in inhibition experiments, to meaningfully change the output predictions we often must clamp features to <span style='font-style: italic;'>negative </span>multiples of their original value, rather than simply to 0. In patching experiments where we add in a feature that was not originally active on a prompt, we often do so using activations significantly greater than that feature’s typical activations.</p>
<p>Why do we need to “overcompensate” in this fashion? We suspect that this is because even when our features play the mechanistic roles that we expect based on attribution graphs, our perturbation experiments capture these mechanisms incompletely:</p>
<ul><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'>Unexplained variance – our feature dictionaries are not infinitely large, and our CLTs do not reconstruct activations fully. Some mechanisms may simply be missing, or the features we extract may be projections of “fuller” ground-truth features that partially reside in this unexplained variance.</li><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'>Inexhaustive feature selection – on any given prompt, there are typically groups of active features with related meanings that have similar edges in the attribution graph. Thus, perturbing any single feature is insufficient – we need to perturb the full group to see its full mechanistic effect. However, identifying “the full group” is not precisely defined, and also cumbersome (it would require inspecting every active feature on every token position for each prompt). Thus, we end up perturbing groups of features that are most likely incomplete, requiring us to choose extra strong perturbation factors to compensate.</li><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'>Incomplete capturing of cross-layer effects – due to the way we perform steering with cross-layer features, our steering results measure the effect of a feature <span style='font-style: italic;'>in a particular layer, </span>rather than the effect of the feature globally (see <a href='#appendix-cross-layer-steering'>§&nbsp;Nuances of Steering with Cross-Layer Features</a>). Thus, our perturbations systematically undervalue features’ whole effects.</li></ul>
<h3><a id='appendix-dupe-features' href='#appendix-dupe-features'>Similar Features and Supernodes</a></h3>
<p>We often find that there are many features in a given graph which seem to have similar roles. There are a few candidate theories for explaining this phenomenon (which we discuss below). Whatever the underlying reason, this suggests that individual features are often best understood as <span style='font-style: italic;'>partial</span> contributors to a component of the mechanism used by the model. To capture these components more completely, we group related features into “supernodes”. While this process is inherently somewhat subjective, we find it is important to clarify key mechanisms.</p>
<p>Grouping features produces a simplified “supernode graph,” where we compute the edges between supernodes according to the formula below:</p>
<p><d-math block sub> \text{supernode\_adjacency}(t, s) = \frac{\sum_{n_t \in N_t} \text{frac\_external}(n_t) \cdot \sum_{n_s \in N_s} A'_{n_t, n_s}}{\sum_{n_t \in N_t} \text{frac\_external}(n_t)} </d-math></p>
<p>Where:</p>
<ul><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'><d-math>N_t</d-math> and <d-math>N_s</d-math> are the set of nodes in supernodes <d-math>t</d-math> and <d-math>s</d-math>, respectively.</li><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'><d-math>n_t</d-math> and <d-math>n_s</d-math> refer to a node in the corresponding supernode.</li><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'><d-math>\text{frac\_external}(n_t)</d-math> is the fraction of the absolute valued input weights to <d-math>n_t</d-math> that originate from nodes outside of the supernode.</li><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'><d-math>A'</d-math> refers to an input normalized graph adjacency matrix, where the weights of edges targeting each node are divided by a constant to sum to 1. <d-math>A'_{n_t, n_s}</d-math> is the normalized edge weight from node <d-math>n_t</d-math> to node <d-math>n_s</d-math>.</li></ul>
<p>Hypotheses for why there so many related features include:</p>
<ul><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'>These features represent subtly different concepts that are hard to discern from our visualization tools. Indeed, in some cases the differences are noticeable – for instance, we may choose to group together a “Texas cities” feature with a feature representing “the state of Texas” if both play a similar role in the circuit. See our <a href='#limitations-abstraction-level'>§&nbsp;Limitations</a> section on feature splitting for more on this issue. A related issue that could be involved is that of <span style='font-style: italic;'>feature manifolds</span> <d-cite key="olah2023manifold,engels2024not,olah2024multidimensional,gorton2024manifold"></d-cite> – concepts which are represented in truly multidimensional fashion by the model. Our CLTs may represent these as collections of hard-to-distinguish features.</li><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'>Features in different layers may represent the same concept, but based on different inputs. For instance, a layer 5 “Michael Jordan” feature may be capable of detecting more indirect references to Michael Jordan, while a layer 1 “Michael Jordan” feature can only detect when the name is written out explicitly.</li><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'>The output response of an MLP after increasing a given input feature is generically nonlinear, even when monotonic, and may require a few CLT features to approximate. (Note that a single-layer MLP with one input dimension and one output dimension can be highly nonlinear as you vary the input, and require multiple features to approximate; composing MLP layers could exacerbate this.) One experiment that could help evaluate this hypothesis would be to perturb an upstream feature using a sweep of strengths, and measure its effect on the activity of a downstream feature; if the Dallas→Austin interaction were capable of being mediated by a single Texas feature, then that dependency would have to be threshold-linear. If it's not, we'd need a group of features to capture the mechanism.</li></ul>
<h3><a id='appendix-patching' href='#appendix-patching'>Iterative Patching</a></h3>
<p>Instead of constrained patching, we may wish to measure the effect of a feature intervention within the patching range in addition to its effect outside of the range. To do so, we can iteratively recompute the values of features which read from layers in the patching range, letting them take on new values due to our intervention. We call this iterative patching. While iterative patching may seem advantageous since it accounts for all of the effects of a feature intervention (at least according to the replacement model), it can often lead to cascading errors, as we need to repeatedly encode and decode features. In addition, the main goal of interventions is to validate edges between nodes and supernodes in attribution graphs. Constrained patching provides a simpler way to do this by limiting indirect effects.</p>
<p>The illustration below shows cascading effects. We patch a feature at layer 1, and impact two features computed at layer 2, and so are affected by our patch. At the end of our patch, we inject the computed state of the residual stream back into the model.</p>
<div class='sn-figma-div' data-args='{"figma_slug":"iterative-patching-svg"}'></div>
<h3><a id='appendix-interventions' href='#appendix-interventions'>Details of Interventions</a></h3>
<p>In this section, we show full intervention results for some of the case studies we discussed above.</p>
<p>Below, we show the effect of inhibiting every supernode in the acronym case study with an inhibition factor of 1.</p>
<div class='sn-figma-div' data-args='{"figma_slug":"patching-ndag-full-1-svg"}'></div>
<p>Supernodes require different steering strengths to show an effect because the strength of their outgoing edges varies. This strength depends both on the number of features in the supernode and their individual edge strengths. The steering plot above shows that inhibiting <span class='fh-span' data-args='18l__b15808787_b27769861_b67082'>“say _A”</span> or <span class='fh-span' data-args='18l__b5477227_b29852699'>“say DA”</span> has only a minor effect on the logit at a strength of −1. This is partially due to <span class='fh-span' data-args='18l__b15808787_b27769861_b67082'>“say _A”</span> containing only one feature, while supernodes like <span class='fh-span' data-args='18l__b27339305_b25733589_b14129802_b8881455_b25876490_b18707149'>“say D_”</span> contain six. <span class='fh-span' data-args='18l__b15808787_b27769861_b67082'>“say _A”</span>’s influence on the logit is also indirect and mediated by the <span class='fh-span' data-args='18l__b5477227_b29852699'>“say DA”</span> supernode. If we increase steering strength to −5, we do observe an effect from inhibiting <span class='fh-span' data-args='18l__b15808787_b27769861_b67082'>“say _A”</span>.</p>

<h3><a id='appendix-interface' href='#appendix-interface'>Notes on the Interface</a></h3>
<p>We share an MIT licensed version of the interactive attribution graph interface used in this paper on <a href='https://github.com/anthropics/attribution-graphs-frontend'>github</a>.</p>
<p>This interface has been simplified from the full version used internally for rapid exploration in favor of a publicly sharable version useful for inspecting labeled graphs. Analysis tools which were trimmed, and may be useful for practitioners to reimplement, include:</p>
<ul><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'>Feature scatterplots comparing arbitrary scalars attached to features during the graph generation pipeline. </li><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'>In situ feature and supernode labeling.</li><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'>Feature examples and additional detail shown on hover to skim through features faster.</li><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'>A diff view comparing two attribution graphs, highlighting the difference and intersections in feature activations and edge weights.</li><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'>A list of all the active features, their labels and edge weight to the active node.</li></ul>

<h3><a id='appendix-res-norms' href='#appendix-res-norms'>Residual Stream Norms Growth</a></h3>
<p>In many models, the norm of the residual stream grows exponentially over the forward pass. Heimersheim and Turner <d-cite key="stefanhex2023resstream"></d-cite> observed this norm growth in the GPT-2, OPT, and Pythia families, and conjectured it serves the functional purpose of making space for new information. Rather than deleting old information by explicitly writing its negative, a layer may simply write new information at a larger magnitude, drowning out the influence of the older information by increasing the denominator of the normalization denominators. Thus to keep information around and legible, the model must actively amplify in many layers. A cross-layer transcoder can absorb all of that into a single feature, while per-layer transcoders or neurons will have features (neurons) in many layers performing the same function, and all will appear in an attribution graph. This does occur <a href='#evaluating-graphs-paths'>in practice</a>.</p>
<p>We observe the same phenomenon in our research model, 18L, which also has normalization denominators.</p>

<h3><a id='appendix-interference-weights' href='#appendix-interference-weights'>Interference Weights over More Features</a></h3>
<p>In the <a href='#global-weights'>main text</a>, we showed a single feature’s virtual weights, and found that many large connections had weak coactivation statistics. Here, we run a similar analysis on a larger sample of features to better understand if this pattern generalizes.</p>
<p>We begin with the set of features that activate on our addition prompts and appear in our pruned attribution graphs. From these, we sample 1000 features with equal representation across layers. We then compute the virtual weights and coactivation statistics for all input and output connections of these features using a dataset of ~150M tokens of the CLT’s training data.</p>
<p>Below, we show the virtual weight distribution across all of these connections, and compare it to the distribution of weights between pairs that ever coactivate on the dataset. The percentage of coactive weights within each bin appears as text labels in the figure.</p>
<div class='sn-figma-div' data-args='{"figma_slug":"virtual-weights-dist-svg"}'></div>
<p>We consider weights between features with no coactivations to be “unused” in our dataset; a source feature that never coactivates with a target feature likely never causally affects the target's activation value.<d-footnote>This interpretation is not strictly true with negative weights, as a strong negative weight might actually prevent coactivation.</d-footnote></p>
<p>In general, a large mass of small weights dominates the distribution (as expected). The smallest weights are very often unused with many bins having single-digit “use percentages.” Large negative weights also stand out as a difference between the raw and coactive distributions, yet this result isn’t surprising (even without interference); if an upstream feature is active, such a strong negative weight might guarantee that its downstream target never activates.</p>
<p>More significantly, we also observe that even among extremely large positive weights (beyond the 99.9999th percentile), a significant proportion are unused. This is not conclusive proof of interference, because we may still miss crucial tokens in our sampling where these edges are used. Still, we take this analysis as suggestive of interference in 18L.</p>
<h3><a id='appendix-full-number-weights' href='#appendix-full-number-weights'>Number Output Weights for Select Features</a></h3>
<p>We show the full output weights (over tokens 0, 1, ..., 999) for three features whose output patterns are neither periodic nor approximate magnitudes. The first promotes “simple numbers”, promoting both smaller numbers and rounder numbers. The second promotes numbers starting with 9, and the latter promotes numbers starting (or, to a lesser degree, ending) with 95. (In the color scheme, upweighted tokens are red and downweighted tokens are blue.)</p>

<h3><a id='appendix-arithmetic-comparison' href='#appendix-arithmetic-comparison'>Comparison of Addition Features Between Small and Large Models</a></h3>
<p>We find similar families of features in Haiku and 18L for performing addition, but note that the ones for 18L are less precise. 18L performs slightly worse on these prompts (98.6% top-1 accuracy vs. 100% for Haiku 3.5), which possibly reflects this imprecision.</p>

<h3><a id='appendix-eval-details' href='#appendix-eval-details'>Additional Evaluation Details</a></h3>
<p>To evaluate our replacement model and attribution graphs, we curated a dataset of random but nontrivial pretraining tokens. Specifically, we considered short sequences from the Pile (minus books) dataset <d-cite key="gao2020pile"></d-cite> and target tokens where</p>
<ul><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'>The underlying model made the correct top-1 prediction;</li><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'>The token has a dataset density less than <code>1e-4</code> to filter out stop tokens and common tokens like articles, punctuations, and newlines;</li><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'>The token did not appear elsewhere in the context (in these cases we often have high graph scores but that the graph is largely mediated by attention which we do not explain);</li><li style='margin-left: 36pt;'>The token has loss >0.2 to filter out other trivial predictions coming from completing multi-token words, fuzzy induction, memorized text, etc.</li></ul>
<p>Due to the expense of graph generation, we used a dataset size of n=260 for graph evaluation.</p>
